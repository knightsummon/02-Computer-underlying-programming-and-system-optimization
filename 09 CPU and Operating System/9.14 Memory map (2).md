## Access Memory Location by Address

– Each physical storage unit has a one-to-one correspondence with the CPU physical address  
– CPU Physic Addresses are allocated by MMU unit  
– Each physical storage unit has a fixed address

## Storage Mapping

– `Storage mapping`: "CPU storage mapping" typically refers to the process of mapping or associating a specific location in the computer's memory (RAM) with a unique address that the CPU (Central Processing Unit) can use to read from or write to that location. This translation allows the CPU to work with a simplified and logical view of memory while the MMU takes care of the actual physical location of data in memory.  
– Each physical storage unit does not have a fixed address, all decided by MMU each time  
– The address of each physical storage unit can be changed through remapping

## Implementation of CPU Storage Mapping

### Related to the processor

– Storage mapping register: start address, end address or size  
– Set `BANK base` address  
– Bitband area, bitband distinguished name  
– Timing: automatically completed by CPU before reset  

## Benefits of CPU Storage Mapping

### Flexible and configurable startup methods
