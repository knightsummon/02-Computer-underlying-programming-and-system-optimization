# 9.10 Interrupt (1): Interrupt Processing Flow





## Interruption & Polling

1. **Interruption**:
   - Interruption is a fundamental concept in computer systems where an external event or condition triggers a temporary pause in the execution of a program or task.
   - It allows the computer's hardware or software to respond to events that require immediate attention, such as hardware errors, keyboard input, or incoming data from a peripheral device.
   - Interruptions help in efficient multitasking and real-time processing by allowing the CPU to handle multiple tasks concurrently.
2. **Polling**:
   - Polling is a technique used in computer systems to continuously check the status or condition of a device or resource to determine if it needs attention.
   - In polling, the CPU periodically checks a specific input or condition, and when the condition is met, it takes appropriate action.
   - Polling can be inefficient because it consumes CPU resources as it constantly checks for changes, even if there are no immediate events to respond to.
3. **Synchronous Communication**:
   - Synchronous communication refers to a method of data transfer where the sender and receiver operate in a synchronized manner, often controlled by a clock signal.
   - **In synchronous communication, both parties must be ready to send and receive data at the same time.**
   - This method often requires constant monitoring and coordination, which can occupy CPU resources, especially in cases where the CPU must wait for data.
4. **Asynchronous Communication**:
   - **Asynchronous communication, on the other hand, is a method of data transfer where data is sent and received without a strict, synchronized timing mechanism.**
   - It allows data to be transmitted when it is ready, and the receiver processes the data as it arrives.
   - Asynchronous communication is more efficient in terms of CPU usage because it doesn't require constant monitoring and synchronization.

## Interrupt

### Importance of Interruption

#### • The clock is the “heart” of the operating system

#### • Interrupts are the entry point for understanding operating systems

– System call  
– Task scheduling  
– Memory management  

## Interrupt Numbers & Interrupt Lines

1. **Interrupt Numbers**:
   - Interrupt numbers are unique identifiers assigned to specific types of interrupts or interrupt sources in a computer system. These numbers are used to map interrupts to their corresponding interrupt service routines (ISRs) or handlers.
   - In x86 systems, interrupt numbers typically range from 0 to 255. Each number corresponds to a particular interrupt source or event. For example, interrupt 0 might be associated with the divide-by-zero exception, while interrupt 1 might be linked to the debug exception.
   - Software and hardware components use these numbers to register and respond to interrupts. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU looks up the associated interrupt number to find the appropriate ISR to execute.
2. **Interrupt Lines**:
   - Interrupt lines, also known as interrupt request (IRQ) lines, are physical or electrical pathways used to signal the presence of an interrupt to the CPU or interrupt controller.
   - In many computer architectures, including x86, interrupt lines are used to connect hardware devices (e.g., peripherals like keyboards, mice, and disk drives) to the interrupt controller. Each hardware device is typically assigned a specific interrupt line.
   - When a hardware device needs the CPU's attention (e.g., it has data to transmit or an error condition to report), it sends an electrical signal on its assigned interrupt line. This signal triggers the interrupt controller to inform the CPU that an interrupt has occurred.
   - Interrupt lines are often prioritized, meaning that devices connected to higher-priority lines will be serviced before those on lower-priority lines.

- **VIC** (Vector Interrupt Controller) is a component responsible for managing and prioritizing interrupts, ensuring they are directed to the appropriate handlers.
- **FIQ** (Fast Interrupt Request) is a type of interrupt with higher priority, designed for handling time-critical and high-priority events.
- **IRQ** (Interrupt Request) is the standard interrupt mechanism used for general-purpose interrupts in ARM processors, with lower priority compared to FIQs.

## Interrupt Vector Table

An **Interrupt Vector Table (IVT)** is a data structure used in computer systems and microcontroller architectures to manage and organize the mapping between interrupt or exception numbers and their corresponding Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs). The IVT is essentially a lookup table that the CPU uses to determine the memory addresses of ISRs when an interrupt or exception occurs.
