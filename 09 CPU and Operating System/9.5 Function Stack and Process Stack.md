# 9.5 Function Stack and Process Stack



## Review: Function Stack Frame

Reference: https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1887824

### The Role of Function Stack Frame

• Save function context  
• Local variables  
• Function parameters  

### Example

```c
int f1(int a) {
    int b = 1;
    return a + b;
}
```

```assembly
push   FP         ; Push the current frame pointer onto the stack  // FP now is a constant
SP = FP           ; Set the stack pointer (SP) to the frame pointer (FP)
SP -= #size_of_locals  ; Allocate space for local variables on the stack

int b = 1;        ; Create a local variable 'b' and assign it the value 1
FP[-b_offset] = #1 ; Store the value of 'b' at the appropriate stack location

return a + b;     ; Calculate the result of 'a + b' and return it

SP = FP           ; Reset the stack pointer (SP) to the frame pointer (FP)
pop    FP         ; Pop the frame pointer to restore the previous frame
ret              ; Return from the function
```

Here's a breakdown of the pseudo-assembly code:

1. `push FP`: This instruction saves the current frame pointer (FP) onto the stack to create a new stack frame for the function `f1`.
2. `SP = FP`: This sets the stack pointer (SP) equal to the frame pointer (FP), effectively initializing the local stack frame.
3. `SP -= #size_of_locals`: This instruction allocates space on the stack for local variables. The size of this space is determined by `#size_of_locals`.
4. `int b = 1;` and `FP[-b_offset] = #1;`: These lines represent the creation and initialization of a local variable `b` with the value `1`. The value of `b` is stored on the stack at `FP[-b_offset]`.
5. `return a + b;`: This calculates the result of `a + b` and returns it. In pseudo-assembly, it's represented as adding `a` (retrieved from `FP[+a_offset]`) and `b` (retrieved from `FP[-b_offset]`).
6. `SP = FP`: This resets the stack pointer (SP) to the frame pointer (FP), effectively deallocating the space allocated for local variables.
7. `pop FP`: This pops the frame pointer to restore the previous frame.
8. `ret`: This instruction represents the return from the function, passing the result in the appropriate register (in this case, R0).

## Task Stack

**The task site needs to be saved (status register, interrupted address)**

### uC/OS Thread Stack(任务栈)

Every task has it own unique thread stack

### Linux OS Process Stack/ User Stack: Site Protection

## Process Stack Size

### Set up Reasonable Stack Space

• If it is too large, the utilization rate is low; if it is too small, it is prone to stack overflow and is unsafe.  
• Function calls, function call levels  
• Local variables, array size  
• Interrupt functions and interrupt calling levels
