The order of execution of tasks

## Task Priority

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<signal.h>

int task_delay[4]={0};

void task1(void)
{
	task_delay[0] = 10;  // you can see the "10" as priority
	printf("task1...\n");
}
void task2(void)
{
	task_delay[1] = 4;
	printf("task2...\n");
}
void task3(void)
{
	task_delay[2] = 4;     // reset the number
	printf("task3...\n");  // Operation
}
void task4(void)
{
	task_delay[3] = 1;
	printf("task4...\n");
}


void timer_interrupt(void)
{
	for(int i=0;i<4;i++)
	{
		if(task_delay[i])
			task_delay[i]--;
	}
	alarm(1);  // This timer will generate the SIGALRM signal after 1 second has passed, and the timer_interrupt function will be called again.
}

void (*task[])(void)={task1,task2,task3,task4};

int main(void)
{
    // this line of code sets up a signal handler for the SIGALRM signal, specifying that when this signal is raised, the timer_interrupt function should be called.
    // alarm(1) sets a timer to generate a SIGALRM signal after 1 second
	signal(SIGALRM,timer_interrupt); // Declare before using
	alarm(1);                       // Declare before using
    //alarm(1); is a non-blocking function call that sets up a timer to generate a signal after a specified time. The timer runs in the background, and when it expires, it generates the signal, which can interrupt the normal execution of the program and call the associated signal handler function (timer_interrupt in this case).
    // alarm(1)->signal()-> timer_interrupt()->task_delay[]==0->taski->reset the number

	int i;
	while(1)
	{
		for(i=0;i<4;i++)
		{
			if(task_delay[i]==0)
			{
				task[i]();  // Pointer Function selects function.
				break;
			}
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
```

## The Principles of Scheduler

### what is Scheduler

• The scheduler is the core of the operating system: Task Switching  
• Multi-Tasking Mechanism: Multiple tasks use the CPU in turn to achieve "concurrency" purposes  
• Task: Each task is an infinite loop  
• Time Slice Rotation: each task runs for xx milliseconds, completed by `clock` or `softIRQ`

#### Preemptive Scheduler:

- Non-preemptive: Time-slice round-robin
- Preemptive: High-priority tasks run first

A preemptive scheduler refers to a scheduling system in which tasks can be interrupted and preempted by higher-priority tasks, ensuring that higher-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority tasks. In contrast, a non-preemptive scheduler, such as time-slice round-robin, allows tasks to run for their allocated time slices without interruption, irrespective of their priority.
