## Embedded Memory

### Different Types of Memory

• Reading and Writing speed  
• Reading and Writing methods  
• Price of Craftsmanship  
• Capacity size  

### Common memory

• ROM  
• Flash  
• SRAM  
• DRAM  

## Memory Classification

### ROM

• `Read Only Memory`: Read only, cannot be written, data will not disappear when power is turned off  
• `PROM`: can be written once  
• `EPROM`: Can be erased by multiple UV irradiations  
• `EEPROM`: Can be electrically erased multiple times, and can access and modify any byte  
• `Flash`: Generalized EEPROM, erased in blocks

### FLASH

•`NOR Flash`: separate data and address lines, with random addressing function  
•`NAND Flash`: Data and address lines are multiplexed and cannot be randomly addressed or read by page.  
•`eMMC`: Nand Flash + read-write controller + MMC protocol interface, BGA package  
•`SD`: Nand Flash + read-write controller + SDIO protocol interface, individually packaged  
•`3D/2D Nand`: SLC, MLC, TLC  
•`SSD`: Nand Flash array + read-write controller

### RAM

•`Random Access Memory`: Readable, writable, data disappears when power is turned off  
•`SRAM`: Static random access memory, fast read and write speed, high cost (6 transistors)  
•`DRAM`: dynamic random access memory, low cost (1 transistor + 1 capacitor), refresh  
•`SDRAM`: Synchronous DRAM: eliminating capacitor charging time and pipeline operations  
•`MCP`: eMCP, ND MCP

### SDRAM

• Commonly Used as Memory: large capacity, cheap price, fast access speed, controller support required  
• DDR SDRAM: 2.5V, Dual Data Rate SDRAM, clock rising/falling edge  
• DDR3: 1.5V, 8Bit prefetch, 1600Mbps  
• DDR4: 1.2V, 3200Mbps

## Memory Interfaces

### SRAM Interface

• Full address/data bus interface: one-to-one correspondence between address and memory unit  
• CPU can be accessed directly  
• SRAM, NOR Flash  

### DRAM Interfaces

• Row address selection (RAS) + column address selection (CAS)  
• CPU accessed through DRAM controller  
• DRAM, SDRAM, DDRx SDRAM  

Serial Interfaces
• Sending address and data serially, slow  
• E2PROM, NAND Flash, SPI NOR Flash
