# 9.8 System Calls (1)



## Code Reuse

### Function Calls

• Custom Functions  
• C Standard Library  
• Third party Libraries  
• Frame  
• Operating System  

## uc/OS multi Tasks Programming

## Operating System Function Expansion

### Operating System Components

• Telecommunication  
• Process management  
• File system  
• Memory management   
• Protocol stack  
• Device management  
• GUI  

## Problems Caused by Complex Functions

### Security Question

• Hardware secure access  
• Resource access violation  
• The system operates stably  
• Chef + queue  

## Authority Management

### Authority Management

• Function call permissions  
• Memory access rights  
• Resource access rights  

### Linux Design Philosophy

• Assign different execution levels to different operations  
• Kernel layer can access any system resources, and user layer programs have limited access rights.  

## User Model and Kernel Mode

### Operating System Privileges

#### – User mode   

#### –Kernel mode  
1. System call/系统调用: int 80h; swi

2. Internal exception

3. External Interruption

   **These three ways can allow `user mode` access `kernel mode`**

### CPU Privilege Level

#### X86 Processor

• ring0: kernel code: 15 privileged instructions + I/O + memory access privileges  
• ring1/ring2  
• ring3: Application: limited access to system resources such as I/O  

#### ARM Processor

• Privileged mode: SYS, FIQ/IRQ, SVC, ABT, UND + privileged instructions MSR, MRS, etc.  
• User mode: USR

## System Call

Basic Concept
• The interface provided by the operating system for application calls: such as chef + call number  
• User mode: application running state, CPU executes user code with privilege level 3  
• Kernel state: Through system calls, the CPU executes kernel code with privilege level 0

## System Call Process

• Prepare parameters and call the system call API interface: `open`  
• Enter the kernel state through soft interrupts, transfer control to the OS, and place parameters in registers  
• CPU queries the code memory address corresponding to the open system call from the `system call table`  
• Get parameters from registers and execute related kernel code corresponding to `open`  
• After execution, copy the running results to user mode and return to user mode  
• CPU executes user mode code and continues execution in user mode

## Advantages of System Calls

### Simplify Application Development

– Provide a unified **hardware abstraction interface** for applications  
– Separates the development of user programs and kernel drivers  

### Authority control ensures the stability and security of the system
