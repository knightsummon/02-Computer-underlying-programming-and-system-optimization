# 9.17 IO Port and IO Memory



## Communication Between CPU and Peripherals

### Direct Assignment

• sbit P10=P1^0;  
• P10 = 1;  
• Assembly format:  

```assembly
–mov P1,#01B
–setb p1.0
```

### Configuration via controller IP register

• GPFCON |= BIT0  
• Set GPF0 as an output pin  
• Output 1: GPFDAT[0]=1

**Registers have no addresses and can only be accessed by name like `register[0]`...**

## IO Port and IO Memory

### Peripheral Controller Registers

#### – Individual addressing

•IO port: Each register corresponds to a port, this port is especially designed by some CPU architecture to specifically accesses the peripheral IO Register, no shared with memory.  
• Port independent addressing: 0~0xFFFF (X86, 16bits)  
• This address has no relation to the memory address   
• Proprietary IN/OUT command read and write register  

#### – Unified addressing

• IO Registers and buffers share memory address space   
• Register address access rights management  
• Memory reads and writes operated IO register, at fast speed
