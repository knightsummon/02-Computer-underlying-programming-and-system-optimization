# 9.9 System Calls (2)



## Linux System Calls

| System Calls       | Example                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| File Operations    | open/close/read/write/lseek/fsync        |
| Process Management | fork/clone/execve/exit/getpid/pause      |
| File System        | mkdir/mknod/rmdir/chmod/rename/mount     |
| System Control     | time/uname/reboot/alarm/ioctl            |
| Memory Management  | brk/mmap/munmap/sync/                    |
| Symbol             | signal/kill                              |
| Socket Control     | Socket/bind/connect/send/listen/shutdown |

## POSIX Standard

• (Standard) Portable Operating System Interface for Computing Systems  
• Specifies the system call interface for applications  
• Header file:/usr/include/unistd  

The POSIX standard defines various system calls, library functions and command line tools, as well as operating system functions related to file systems, process control, user permissions, system signals, etc.

1. **POSIX Shells and Utilities**: Defines a set of standard command-line utilities like ls, cp, mv, grep, as well as a portable scripting language (the Shell).
2. **POSIX File System Interface**: Specifies operations related to files and directories, including file I/O, permissions, symbolic links, and more.
3. **POSIX Process Control Interface**: Covers process creation, management, signal handling, and inter-process communication (IPC).
4. **POSIX Thread Interface**: Defines standards for multithreaded programming, including thread creation, synchronization, and mutexes.
5. **POSIX Networking Interface**: Covers socket programming for network communication.
6. **POSIX Timing and Clock Interface**: Includes timers, sleep, and clock management functions.

## System Calls and Standard C Library

### Differences and Connections

• System calls run in kernel mode, and C library functions run in user mode.  
• C standard library function implementation: secondary encapsulation of system calls

```bash
strace ./a.out 
```

Use this command line to see what beneath the function`fopen`
