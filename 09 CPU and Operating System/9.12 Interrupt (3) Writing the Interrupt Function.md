# 9.12 Interrupt (3) Writing the Interrupt Function



## Interrupts

### Interrupt Characteristics

• Ability to interrupt ongoing tasks anytime.  
• Ability to interrupt ongoing tasks anywhere   
• After interrupt return, the CPU may not necessarily re-execute the interrupted task  (May do higher Priority task)

### Interrupt Function

• The calling time is not fixed: you have to protect the scene yourself when interrupting  
• The calling location is not fixed: parameters cannot be passed to the interrupt function  
• The return location is not fixed: the interrupt function cannot have a return value  

However, while ISRs typically don't return values directly, they can communicate with other parts of the system or application to convey information about the interrupt event or its outcome. Some common techniques for such communication include:

- **Global Variables:** ISRs can update global variables that are accessed by other parts of the program.
- **Shared Data Structures:** ISRs can write data into shared data structures that are designed for inter-process communication (IPC).
- **Flags and Status Registers:** ISRs can set flags or status bits that are checked by other parts of the program.

## Interrupt Function in Bare Metal Environment

### Basic Process

#### •Save interruption site

–Status register, return address pushed onto stack  
–The registers to be used in the interrupt function are pushed onto the stack  

#### •Clear interrupts//turn off interrupts to protect the scene (Temporarily disable or turn off interrupt requests). Some hardware will automatically clear them. Remember to clear them before restarting and enabling interrupts.

#### •Execute interrupt function body

#### •Restore site

– Pop the registers in the stack and restore the interrupted scene  
– Pop the PC from the stack and continue execution of the interrupted program

### Keywords

• ARM compiler: __irq  
• 51 compiler: interrupt

## UCOS Interrupt Function

### Basic Process

#### •Save the interrupted task task1 interruption scene 保护中断现场

–The status register and return address of PC are pushed into the `task1 task stack`  
–Push the general registers used in the interrupt function into the `task1 task stack `   
–Save the current task stack pointer （SP）//This step often requires manual operation  

#### •Interrupt nesting count +1

#### •Execute interrupt function body

#### •Task scheduling: Find the next task to run task2 //Call the OS API // Finished by the OS, different with bare metal environment.

#### •Restore site

– Pop the status register and stack pointer in the task2 task stack
– Pop the PC from the task stack through the interrupt return instruction and execute task task2

### Interrupts Function Under Linux

#### Interrupt function implementation

•Return type: `typedef irqreturn_t (*irq_handler_t)(int, void *)`;  
•Function form: `irqreturn_t keyboard_isr(int irq, void *dev_id); ` 
•Interrupts registration: `request_irq(unsigned int irq, irq_handler_t handler, unsigned long flags, const char *name, void *dev) `
