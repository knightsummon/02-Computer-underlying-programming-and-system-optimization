# 9.21 Memory Management Unit MMU (1)



## MMU

The Memory Management Unit (MMU) is a crucial component of a computer's hardware that plays a fundamental role in the management of a computer's memory. **Its primary function is to translate virtual memory addresses used by software programs(Loaded inside CPU) into physical memory addresses in the computer's RAM (Random Access Memory).**

Here's a breakdown of its main functions and responsibilities:

1. **Virtual-to-Physical Address Translation**: The MMU takes virtual memory addresses generated by running processes and translates them into physical memory addresses. This translation allows the operating system to use a technique called virtual memory, which provides each process with the illusion of having its own dedicated memory space, even though the physical RAM is shared among multiple processes.
2. **Memory Protection**: The MMU enforces memory protection by assigning permissions to different regions of memory. This ensures that processes cannot access or modify memory locations outside their allocated space, preventing one process from interfering with or corrupting the memory of another.
3. **Memory Segmentation**: In some systems, the MMU is responsible for dividing memory into segments with different access rights and attributes. This segmentation allows for more fine-grained control over memory access.
4. **Caching**: Modern MMUs often incorporate memory caches, such as Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs), to speed up the address translation process. These caches store recently translated virtual-to-physical address mappings, reducing the need to perform expensive memory lookups for frequently accessed memory locations.
5. **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**: The MMU can be used to implement security features like ASLR, which randomizes the location of program code and data in memory to make it more challenging for attackers to predict and exploit vulnerabilities.
6. **Memory Paging**: Many MMUs implement memory paging, a technique that divides physical memory into fixed-size blocks (pages) and manages the mapping of virtual pages to physical pages. This allows for efficient memory allocation and swapping data in and out of RAM when it's needed.

During software development, the file is directly linked to a virtual address without considering the actual physical address when the software is running. Because the MMU will automatically assign the virtual address to the Physical address. You can see the app1 and app2 after `readelf -h`, showing the program entry is `0x1000`
