# 9.3 Multi-Tasking Bare Metal Implementation (Part 2) : State Machine



## The Execution Time for each Task

Reasonably arrange running time of each task

## Decomposition of long-delayed Tasks

The decomposition of long-delayed tasks refers to the process of breaking down or dividing tasks that take a significant amount of time to complete into smaller, more manageable subtasks or subcomponents. This approach is used to address the challenges posed by tasks that are time-consuming or have lengthy durations.

Here's an explanation of the concept:

1. **Long-Delayed Tasks**: These are tasks or activities that require a substantial amount of time to finish. Long delays can be problematic because they can lead to inefficiencies, delays in project completion, or unresponsiveness in systems or applications.
2. **Break into Subtasks**: To tackle long-delayed tasks effectively, one strategy is to break them into smaller, more achievable subtasks. Each subtask is a self-contained portion of the overall task and can be completed independently. These subtasks are typically more manageable in terms of time and effort.
3. **Benefits**:
   - **Improved Manageability**: Breaking a complex task into subtasks makes it easier to manage and track progress. It allows individuals or teams to focus on completing one subtask at a time, which can enhance productivity.
   - **Parallelism**: Subtasks can often be worked on concurrently by different individuals or components, reducing the overall time required to complete the task.
   - **Debugging and Testing**: Smaller subtasks are easier to debug and test, making it simpler to identify and fix issues or errors.
   - **Fault Isolation**: If a subtask fails or encounters a problem, it can often be isolated and addressed without affecting the entire task.
4. **Example**:
   - Imagine a software program that needs to process a large dataset and perform multiple complex operations on it. Instead of attempting to process the entire dataset in one go, the task can be decomposed into subtasks such as data loading, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. Each subtask can be worked on independently by different team members or components of the software.
5. **Application**:
   - Decomposition of long-delayed tasks is commonly used in project management, software development, and engineering to ensure that large projects or tasks are completed efficiently and with reduced risks of delays.

## Finite State Machine

A Finite State Machine is a computational model that represents a system's behavior by defining a finite set of states and the transitions between them based on input conditions.

## Example:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

unsigned int count;
void rtc_interrupt(void)
{
	for(int i=0;i<500000;i++)
		;		
	count++;
}

void task1(void)
{
	static int task1_state=0;
	switch(task1_state){
		case 0:
			task1_state++;
			printf("task1:step 0\n");
			break;
		case 1:
			task1_state++;
			printf("task1:step 1\n");
			break;
		case 2:
			task1_state++;
			printf("task1:step 2\n");
			break;
		case 3:
			task1_state++;
			printf("task1:step 3\n");
			break;
		default:
			printf("task1: undefined step\n");
			break;
	}
}
void task2(void)
{
	static int task2_state=0;
	switch(task2_state){
		case 0:
			task2_state++;
			printf("task2:step 0\n");
			break;
		case 1:
			task2_state++;
			printf("task2:step 1\n");
			break;
		case 2:
			task2_state++;
			printf("task2:step 2\n");
			break;
		case 3:
			task2_state++;
			printf("task2:step 3\n");
			break;
		default:
			printf("task2: undefined step\n");
			break;
	}
}


int main(void)
{
	while(1)
	{
		if(count%1000==0)
			task1();

		if(count%2000==0)
			task2();
		rtc_interrupt();
	}

	return 0;
}
```

**State Machine: give every subtask a number for switch() to choose.**

## Question 3

### How to prioritize tasks?

Use the kernel files, Operating system files, program can manage Task Preemption (抢占式多任务处理)
