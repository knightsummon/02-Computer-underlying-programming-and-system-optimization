## The Context of a Process

The context of a process consists of the contents of its (user) [address space](https://www.beyonddiscovery.org/unix-operating-system/65-manipulation-of-the-process-address-space.html) and the contents of hardware registers and kernel data structures that relate to the process. Formally, the context of a process is the union of its user-level context, register context, and system-level context.1 The user-level context consists of the process text, data, user stack, and shared memory that occupy the virtual address space of the process.

### Task Stack

**Task Stack:** A task stack is designed for saving CPU's PC, Status Register and SP into the stack, waiting for CPU recovery while interruption happening. The stack follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, allowing for efficient management of function calls and returns.

## The Stack is the Basis for Running C Language

• Function Call: local variables, function parameters, return address, registers  
• On-site Protection: status Register, Stack Pointer, PC  

## Stack Position Independent Accessing

The Stack inner can not be accessed by function name.

### Wherever the SP points, Processor can execute it on there

Function stack frame symbolic access: SP/FP + relative offset  

Because in the stack there are local variables which will dynamically allocated memory. Use function name to access will meet a issue: delay. when the local variable is withdrawn, the function name is still in .txt segmentation, it will cause null pointer.

## Process Stack

**Process Stack:** The process stack, commonly known as the stack, is a memory region associated with a computer process. It is used to store the program's execution context, including function call information, local variables, and other data necessary for proper program execution. The stack operates based on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, facilitating efficient function call and return operations.

## Linux Process Kernel Stack

In a Linux operating system, each process has an associated kernel stack, often referred to as the "kernel-mode stack" or simply the "kernel stack." The kernel stack is a dedicated region of memory used exclusively by the kernel to execute and manage system calls and other kernel-related operations on behalf of a process. Here's an explanation of the Linux process kernel stack:

**Kernel Stack for a Process:**

- **Each process running on a Linux system has its own kernel stack**. This kernel stack is separate from the user-mode stack, which is used by the process's user-level code for function calls and managing local variables.

**Purpose and Usage:**

- The kernel stack is primarily used when a process transitions from user mode to kernel mode, typically when making system calls or handling interrupts. In these situations, the processor switches from executing user-level code to executing kernel code, and it needs a separate stack to manage this transition.

**System Calls and Interrupt Handling:**

- When a process makes a system call (e.g., `read`, `write`, `fork`) or when an interrupt occurs (e.g., a hardware interrupt or a software interrupt triggered by a system call), the processor switches to kernel mode. At this point, the kernel stack is used to execute the kernel code required to handle the system call or interrupt.

**Kernel Stack Contents:**

- The kernel stack typically contains the following information:
  - The execution context for the kernel, including CPU registers, program counter, and other processor state information.
  - Local variables and function call information specific to the kernel's processing of the system call or interrupt.
  - Data structures necessary for the kernel's internal bookkeeping and management of the process.

## Interrupts Stack

### What is the Interrupt Stack

• Interrupt function call  
• Interrupt nested field protection  

![08](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/09%20CPU%20and%20Operating%20System/9.11%20Interrupt%20(2)%20Process%20Stack%20and%20Interrupt%20Stack.assets/08.jpg)

When the Program used Kernel Stack, the interrupts stack will in the kernel space.

### Interrupts Stack

• Share memory space with kernel stack  
• Independent interrupt stack: hard interrupt stack, soft interrupt stack  

### Total Stack Space Size (Dynamically)

• Local variables and parameters of the task function body  
• Function call Levels  
• Interrupts nesting levels
