## Register

Datasheets for hardware components, microcontrollers, and other electronic devices typically provide detailed information about register addresses, their purposes, and how to interact with them. These datasheets are usually available on the manufacturer's website or through authorized distributors.

## Register Read and Write Operations

###  Operational Requirements 

•Set bit_0, bit_5, and bit_9 of the register   
•Clear bit_6, bit_12, and bit_23 of the register

Assuming you have a 32-bit register named `myRegister`, and you want to set or clear specific bits as per your requirements:

```c
// Define the register address and size (32 bits)
volatile uint32_t* registerAddress = (uint32_t*)0xADDRESS; // Replace '0xADDRESS' with the actual register address

// Set bit_0, bit_5, and bit_9
*registerAddress |= (1u << 0);   // Set bit_0
*registerAddress |= (1u << 5);   // Set bit_5
*registerAddress |= (1u << 9);   // Set bit_9

// Clear bit_6, bit_12, and bit_23
*registerAddress &= ~(1u << 6);  // Clear bit_6
*registerAddress &= ~(1u << 12); // Clear bit_12
*registerAddress &= ~(1u << 23); // Clear bit_23
```
