# 9.16 Memory,External Storage and Peripherals



## Embedded Storage

--- Deposit 寄存  
--- Cache 缓存  
--- Memory 内存  
--- Peripheral Storage 外存  

## Storage Classification

### Memory (内存)

• Also known as main memory: a storage space that the CPU can directly address and has fast access speed  
• Including: RAM, ROM, cache, etc.

### External Storage

• Also known as auxiliary memory: storage other than CPU cache and memory  
• Including: disk, NAND Flash, SD card, EEPROM, etc  

## Storage Design

– Program installation  
-Program running  
–Memory reading and writing

## Peripherals

• The collective name for input and output devices in computer systems (including external memory)  
• Peripherals: mouse, keyboard, graphics card, sound card, printer, disk  
• Peripheral interfaces: UART, USB, I2C, GPIO, I2S, Ethernet, AD/DA    

## Peripherals' Controller

## Basic Function

• Device control: turn on, turn off, run  
• Protocol control: USB, I2C  
• Data conversion: sequence stream, byte stream  
• Data buffer: buffer, FIFO

## Communication Between CPU and Peripherals

1. **Polling**(轮询):
   - **Definition**: Polling is a straightforward method where the CPU periodically checks the status of a peripheral to determine if it needs attention or data transfer.
   - **How it works**: The CPU sends a request or checks the status register of a peripheral at regular intervals. If the peripheral has data or needs service, the CPU handles the task. If not, it continues to poll until the peripheral is ready.
   - Pros:
     - Simple and easy to implement.
     - Suitable for low-speed or low-priority peripherals.
   - Cons:
     - Inefficient for high-speed or time-sensitive peripherals as it wastes CPU cycles in constant checking.
     - Can introduce latency and delay in responding to the peripheral.
2. **Interrupts**:
   - **Definition**: Interrupts are signals sent by peripherals to the CPU to request immediate attention or to notify the CPU that a specific event has occurred.
   - **How it works**: When a peripheral has data or an event to report, it sends an interrupt request to the CPU. The CPU then temporarily suspends its current task, saves its state, and jumps to an interrupt service routine (ISR) to handle the peripheral's request.
   - Pros:
     - Efficient for high-speed or time-sensitive peripherals as it allows the CPU to respond immediately.
     - Reduces CPU load when compared to polling since the CPU only acts when an interrupt occurs.
   - Cons:
     - Requires additional hardware to manage interrupts.
     - May introduce complexity due to managing multiple interrupts.
3. **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**:
   - **Definition**: DMA is a method that allows peripherals to transfer data directly to or from memory without involving the CPU for each data transfer.
   - **How it works**: A DMA controller is used to manage data transfers between peripherals and memory. The CPU initiates the transfer by setting up the DMA controller, and then the DMA controller handles the data movement independently of the CPU.
   - Pros:
     - Highly efficient for high-speed data transfers as it offloads the CPU from managing each transfer.
     - Reduces CPU overheads and allows the CPU to perform other tasks.
   - Cons:
     - Requires a dedicated DMA controller, which adds cost and complexity to the system.
     - Requires careful coordination to avoid conflicts in memory access.

## Cache

### is the cache inside the CPU or not?

Yes, caches are typically located inside the CPU (Central Processing Unit) or in close proximity to it on the same chip. CPU caches are a crucial component of modern computer architecture, and they help improve the performance of the CPU by reducing the time it takes to access frequently used data.
