# 6.5 Data Alignment



## What is the Data Alignment?

Data alignment, in the context of computer systems and programming, refers to the memory allocation and arrangement of data in a way that takes into account the requirements of the hardware's memory access patterns and efficiency. Proper data alignment can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of a program.

Most modern computer architectures have specific memory alignment requirements for different types of data. This alignment requirement often depends on the size of the data and the specific hardware architecture. For example, a 32-bit integer might need to be aligned to a memory address that's a multiple of 4 bytes, while a 64-bit double precision floating-point number might need to be aligned to a multiple of 8 bytes.

Data alignment is important for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Misaligned data can lead to slower memory access times or even hardware exceptions on certain architectures. Aligned data allows the processor to fetch data more efficiently from memory.
2. **Cache Efficiency**: Modern processors have memory hierarchies with different levels of cache. Aligned data can improve cache utilization, reducing cache misses and improving performance.
3. **Atomic Operations**: Some architectures require data to be aligned for certain atomic operations to work correctly. Misaligned data might lead to unexpected behavior in such cases.
4. **Vectorization**: Data alignment can be crucial for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, which process multiple data elements in parallel. Proper alignment allows these instructions to work optimally.

## The Guideline of Data Alignment

For example, if a 32-bit integer is placed at memory address 5, it's not aligned to 4-byte boundaries (since 5 % 4 = 1), and accessing it might be less efficient on certain architectures.

The concept of address(ox 1111 1111) divisibility by a certain power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, etc, the length of specified data type) is a way to ensure that data is stored in memory in a manner that aligns well with the hardware's memory access patterns. This improves memory access speed and cache utilization.

## Why Date Alignment?

### CPU Hardware Limitations

• Different hardware platforms manage storage space differently  
• To simplify CPU hardware design, address access is simplified  
• The compiler will choose the appropriate alignment based on the hardware platform  

**Optimize The CPU Running Time**

## Struct Data Alignment

```c
struct 
{
    char a;
    short int b;
    int c;
    char d;
}
```

## Union Data Structure Alignment

### Alignment Principle

• Allocate space based on maximum member size
• The alignment of the union: the least common multiple of the alignment bytes of each member

The all Union member shared the same space.

## Specify the Compiler how to align the data type

```shell
•#pragma pack(8)
•__attribute__((aligned(8)))
•__attribute__((packed))
```

`__attribute__((aligned(8)))`:

This attribute is used to control the alignment of variables or data structures in memory. Alignment refers to the memory address at which a variable or data structure starts. By default, compilers align variables based on their size, which can lead to better performance when accessing memory, especially for certain hardware architectures.

The `aligned` attribute allows you to specify a custom alignment for a variable or data structure. In the case of `__attribute__((aligned(8)))`, you are instructing the compiler to align the variable or structure to an 8-byte boundary. This means that the starting memory address of the variable will be a multiple of 8.

```c
struct Example {
    int a;
    char b;
} __attribute__((aligned(8)));
```

`__attribute__((packed))`:

This attribute is used to indicate to the compiler that you want a variable or data structure to be packed, meaning that there should be no padding between its members for alignment purposes. By default, compilers often add padding between structure members to ensure proper alignment and improve memory access performance.

However, there are times when you want to save memory space and are willing to trade off some performance. In such cases, you can use `__attribute__((packed))` to prevent the compiler from adding any padding.

```c
struct PackedExample {
    char a;
    int b;
} __attribute__((packed));
```

### Example: Use pack to optimize the Memory Occupation but slow the CPU Reading Speed
