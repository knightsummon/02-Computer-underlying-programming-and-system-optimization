# 6.19 Double Pointer and Array Pointer



## When Array is Used as Function Parameter

### One-Dimensional Array:

- When you pass a one-dimensional array as a function parameter, the array name is implicitly converted to the address of the first element of the array. This means that the function receives a pointer to the first element of the array, which is essentially a first-level pointer.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function that takes a one-dimensional array as a parameter
void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int myArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int length = sizeof(myArray) / sizeof(myArray[0]);

    // Calling the function with the array
    printArray(myArray, length);

    return 0;
}

```

### Pointer Array:

- When you pass a pointer array (an array of pointers) as a function parameter, you are actually passing the address of the first element of the pointer array. In other words, you are passing a double pointer or a pointer to a pointer.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function that takes a pointer array as a parameter
void printStrings(char *strArr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%s\n", strArr[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    char *myStrings[] = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"}; // myStrings -> "Apple", *myStrings -> "A", double pointer
    int length = sizeof(myStrings) / sizeof(myStrings[0]);// calculates the number of elements in the array myStrings by dividing the size of the entire array by the size of one element within the array. This is a common technique used in C and C++ to determine the length of an array when its size is not known explicitly.

    // Calling the function with the pointer array (double pointer)
    printStrings(myStrings, length);

    return 0;
}

```



## When Array as Parameter

| Argument when data passing through | Parameter in the Function Format             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| int a[5]                           | f( int a[], int len) / f( int *p, int len)   |
| int *a[5]                          | f( int **p, int len) / f( int *a[], int len) |

## Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
char *season[4] = {"Spring","Summer","Autumn","Winter"};
void array_print(char *a[],int len)
{
	int i;
	for(i=0; i<len; i++)
		printf("hello %s!\n",a[i]);
}
void array_print2(char **a,int len)
{
	int i;
	for(i=0; i<len; i++)
		printf("hello %s!\n",a[i]);
}
// a is point to the "S" of the "Spring", but remember, the Char **a or char *a[] is just a data sent in, the a[] in the function body derefere it, make the pointer a becomes season[] address.
int main(void)
{	
	array_print(season,4);
	array_print2(season,4);
	return 0; 
} 
int main(int argc,char *argv[]); 
int main(int argc,char **argv);
```

### what difference between "char **a" and "char *a[]"?

`char **a`:

- `char **a` is a pointer to a pointer to a character, which means it can be used to represent a dynamically allocated array of strings or a pointer to an array of strings.
- It is often used when you want to work with an array of strings, and each string is represented as a `char*`.
- You can dynamically allocate memory for an array of strings and use `char **` to point to the first element of this array.

```c
char **strArray; // Pointer to an array of strings
```

`char *a[]`:

- `char *a[]` is an array of pointers to characters, which means it represents a fixed-size array of strings.
- It is used when you have a known number of strings, and you want to store them in an array.

```c
char *strArray[] = {"String1", "String2", "String3"}; // Fixed-size array of strings
```

- **Dynamic vs. Fixed Size**: `char **a` is typically used for dynamic arrays, where you can allocate memory for strings at runtime, while `char *a[]` is used for fixed-size arrays where you know the number of strings in advance.
- **Memory Allocation**: With `char **a`, you need to allocate memory for the array of pointers and then allocate memory for each individual string separately. With `char *a[]`, you declare the array size upfront, and each element can point to a string or a string literal.
- **Flexibility**: `char **a` allows you to change the size of the array (the number of strings) dynamically by allocating or deallocating memory. `char *a[]` has a fixed size determined at compile-time.

```c
char **dynamicArray; // Dynamic array of strings
char *fixedArray[] = {"String1", "String2", "String3"}; // Fixed-size array of strings

// Dynamic allocation with char **
dynamicArray = (char **)malloc(3 * sizeof(char *));
dynamicArray[0] = "DynamicString1";
dynamicArray[1] = "DynamicString2";
dynamicArray[2] = "DynamicString3";

// Fixed-size array with char *[]
// The size is fixed at 3, and you cannot add more strings without resizing the array.
```
