# 6.7 Data Portability



```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
printf("size: %d \n", sizeof(int));
return 0;
}
```

This Program's can be different on different Compiler,  `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes (32 bits) on 32-bit systems and 4 bytes or 8 bytes (32 bits or 64 bits) on 64-bit systems.

## Typedef

1. ### Creating a new type alias:

```c
typedef int Age; // Define 'Age' as an alias for the 'int' data type
Age personAge = 25; // You can use 'Age' as a type now
```

2. ### Defining a more complex type:

```c
typedef struct{
	int x;
	int y;
}Point; // Define 'Point' as an alias for a structure

Point p1; // You can now use 'Point' to declare variables of the structure type
```

###     3.Creating aliases for pointer types: 
You can also use "typedef" to create aliases for pointer types, which can be helpful in managing complex data structures or improving code readability

```c
typedef int* IntPtr; // Define 'IntPtr' as an alias for a pointer to 'int'

IntPtr p = NULL; // You can now use 'IntPtr' to declare pointer variables
```

## Use Typedef to Define the Data Type

```c
typedef unsigned char                 u8; // define the unsigned char a new alias name
typedef unsigned short                u16;
typedef unsignd int                   u32;
typedef unsigned long long            u64;
typedef signed char                   s8;
typedef short                         s16;
typedef int                           s32;
typedef long long                     s64;
```

### **stdint.h**:

- **Purpose**: "stdint.h" stands for "Standard Integer Types." Its primary purpose is to define a set of integer types with guaranteed sizes, regardless of the platform or compiler. This helps ensure portability of code across different systems.

- Types Defined

  : "stdint.h" defines a set of fixed-size integer types with names that indicate their size and signedness. These types include:

  - `int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`: Signed integers with the specified number of bits (e.g., `int32_t` is a 32-bit signed integer).
  - `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, `uint64_t`: Unsigned integers with the specified number of bits.
  - `int_leastN_t` and `uint_leastN_t`: These types guarantee at least N bits.
  - `int_fastN_t` and `uint_fastN_t`: These types are optimized for speed and may have at least N bits.
  - `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t`: Integer types capable of holding a pointer.

```c
#include <stdint.h>

int32_t myInt = 42;
uint16_t myUnsignedInt = 65535;
```

### **inttypes.h**:

- **Purpose**: "inttypes.h" is an extension to "stdint.h" and provides a set of macros for formatting and scanning values of the fixed-size integer types defined in "stdint.h." It's especially useful for platform-independent input and output operations involving these types.
- **Macros Defined**: "inttypes.h" defines macros like `PRIu8`, `PRIi16`, `SCNu32`, etc., which are used in `printf` and `scanf` format strings to specify the correct format for these types.

```c
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int32_t myInt = 42;
uint16_t myUnsignedInt = 65535;

printf("Value of myInt: %" PRId32 "\n", myInt);
printf("Value of myUnsignedInt: %" PRIu16 "\n", myUnsignedInt);
```

### Summary

 "stdint.h" provides a set of fixed-size integer types, while "inttypes.h" extends this by providing macros for consistent formatting and scanning of these types. These headers are crucial for writing portable code that behaves consistently across different platforms and compilers, particularly when dealing with low-level data manipulation and I/O.

## Embedded operating system transplantation

• Big-little Endian mode
• Data alignment
• Word length:
	– μC/OS  
	 – Linux  

Define the datatype on the uc/os.h
