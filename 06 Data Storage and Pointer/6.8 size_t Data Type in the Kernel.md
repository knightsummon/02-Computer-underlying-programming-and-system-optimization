# 6.8 size_t Data Type in the Kernel



## Size_t

The purpose of adding the "_t" suffix after size is to emphasize that a certain name is a type alias, not an ordinary variable or function name. This helps avoid naming conflicts and improve code readability

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// define an alias for the data type
typedef unsigned int size_t_t;  // alias suffix _t
typedef unsigned long int size_t_l;  // alias suffix _t

int main() {
    size_t_t num1 = 10;
    size_t_l num2 = 20;

    printf("num1: %u\n", num1);
    printf("num2: %lu\n", num2);

    return 0;
}
```

## Benefits of Size_t: Adaptability

Portability: To ensure that your code works correctly on different platforms, you should use a type such as "size_t", whose size is defined to be the **maximum length suitable for the current platform**. This means that on 32-bit platforms, "size_t" will usually be 32 bits, and on 64-bit platforms, it will usually be 64 bits. This allows the code to adapt to different platforms without causing problems due to platform differences.
