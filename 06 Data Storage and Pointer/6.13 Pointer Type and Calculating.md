## Pointer Arithmetic

### The meaning of the P+1: P+1*sizeof(type)

## Pointer Subtraction

• Premise: The types must be consistent, they can only be subtracted, not added.  
• Represents the distance between two pointers in memory  
•The unit is the length of the data type sizeof(type), not bytes  
• Generally used in the same array to calculate the deviation of two elements

## Pointer Comparison 

• Premise: pointers of the same type  
• Generally used in the same array and linked list  
• Operation result:

```c
p < q: The data pointed by p is in front of the data pointed by q
p > q: The data pointed by p follows the data pointed by q
p == q: p and q point to the same data
p != q: p and q point to different data
```

##  Experiment: Reverse a String

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	char a[20],tmp;
	printf("input string:");
	gets(a);
	char *p,*q;
	p = q = a;
	p += strlen(a)-1; 
	while(q<p)
	{
		tmp = *q;
		*q++ = *p;//In the expression *q++, the ++ operator is a postfix increment operator. It increments the value of q after the value at the original address pointed to by q is used in the expression. This can be distinguished by "++q" and "q++". For(int i; i++; i<100)
		*p-- = tmp; //Same to the upper.
	}
	puts(a);
	return 0; 
} 
```
