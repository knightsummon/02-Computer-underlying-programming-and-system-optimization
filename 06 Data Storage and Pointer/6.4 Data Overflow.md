# 6.4 Data Overflow



```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	char i;
	for(i=0; i<130; i++)
	{
		printf("*");
	}
	return 0;
}
```

## Why this Program will ended up on Endless Loop?

In the `for` loop, the variable `i` is of type `char`. A `char` is typically an 8-bit data type, which can hold values from -128 to 127 (assuming a signed `char`). When you initialize `i` with `0` and then increment it inside the loop using `i++`, it starts at `0` and gradually increases.

However, when `i` reaches its maximum positive value (127), incrementing it further will cause it to wrap around to its minimum negative value (-128) due to integer overflow. In this case, the loop condition `i<130` will always be satisfied, as -128 is less than 130. So, the loop will continue executing indefinitely, causing the endless loop.

To avoid this, you can either change the data type of `i` to an `int` or adjust the loop condition to something that makes more sense, depending on what you want the program to achieve.

### Data Type int Range

1. 16-bit systems: The range is usually from -32,768 to 32,767.
2. 32-bit systems: The range is typically from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
3. 64-bit systems: The range is usually from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

## What is Data Overflow

**The data exceeds the range that the data can represent.**

## How to Detect the Int Data Type Overflows?

### Signed Data Plus Together

​	when two positive data added up, the result's complement code is less than 0, meaning overflow happened  

​    when two negative data added up, the result's complement code is more than 0, meaning overflow happened  

### Unsigned Data Plus Together

​	when Two number added up, the result is less than the minimal one of two, meaning the overflow happened.
