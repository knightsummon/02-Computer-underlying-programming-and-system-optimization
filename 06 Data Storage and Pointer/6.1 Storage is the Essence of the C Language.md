# 6.1 Storage is the Essence of the C Language



## Understand Data Storage

• Variables, pointers, stacks, and linked lists are all just representation.  
• The essence of all problems can be reduced to storage  
• Storage is implemented through the compiler  
• The interface left by the compiler to the programmer: KEYWORDS

Program = Data Structure + Algorithm

### keywords

| auto   | break  | case   | char   | const | continue | default  | do     |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| double | else   | enum   | extern | float | typedef  | goto     | if     |
| int    | long   | signed | return | short | register | sizeof   | static |

## Importance of Storage

• Optimization method 1: algorithm to reduce the number of instructions and improve operating efficiency  
• Optimization method 2: caching, changing data storage method, reading and writing speed  
• Memory error: access to illegal memory unit, data overflow, memory error

  

## Intended Purpose

• Master the use of common data in C language: alignment, type conversion, portability  
• In-depth understanding and mastery of C pointers  
• Be familiar with various pitfalls in the use of common data types
