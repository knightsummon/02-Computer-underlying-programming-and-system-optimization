# 6.3 Signed and Unsigned Number



## Data Type

### Signed & Unsigned

• Default is `signed`
• Print data format: %d %u
• Data Range
    	– Signed numbers: [-128,127]  
    	– Unsigned number: [0,255]

## 原码：Original code 反码: Inverse Code 补码：Complement Code

```
•Example:-3
•Original code: 1000 0011
•Inverse code: 1111 1100
•Complement: 1111 1101
•Example: 3
•Original code: 0000 0011
•Complement code: 0000 0011
```

## Data Storage on Different Type

### Computer uses Compliment Code to store data

### Storage of unsigned numbers

• There is no original code or complement code for unsigned numbers, and the true value is directly converted into binary  

### Storage of signed numbers

• Signed numbers are stored in two’s complement format  
• The complement of a positive number: equal to its original code  
• The complement of a negative number: the negative number's Inverse code **+** 1  

## 0 Encoding Issue

### +0 and -0 Encoding

+0 

```
original Code: 0000 0000
Complement Code:0000 0000
```

-0

```
Original Code: 1000 0000
Inverse Code: 1111 1111  // the sign bit is not invert
Complement Code: 0000 0000 //the sign bit is participated in the carry
```

### Advantages of using Complement Code

• Solved the encoding problem of 0  
• One more minimum value can be saved: for example, signed char can save a new value ` -128`  
• The saved value -128 only has complement code `10000000`, no original code and complement code  

## Why do computers use complement codes to store data?

• Solve the encoding problem of 0  
• Subtraction operations can be converted into additions, eliminating the need for hardware subtraction circuits. The CPU only needs a full adder and a complement circuit.
• The sign bit can also participate in operations and be processed uniformly with other bits. When numbers represented by two's complement numbers are added and there is a carry in the highest bit, the carry is discarded.

### Example

```
7 + (-3)

7
Original Code, Complement Code: 0000 0111
-3 Complement code:             1111 1101
7 + (-3):                       0000 0100

-3
original code:                  1000 0011
Invert Code:                    1111 1100
Complement Code:                1111 1101
```
