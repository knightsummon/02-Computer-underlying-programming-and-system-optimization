# 6.2 The Basic Conception of Storage



## Storage Unit

**Bit(位)**: The minimal storage unit  
**Byte(字节)**: The Computer Commonly Used Unit  
**Word(字)**：The Developer Commoly Used Unit, The 64 bits Computer means the CPU architecture is 64 bit, which means that one word includes 64 binary bits.

## Big-Endian & Little-Endian

### Different processors have different storage modes:

»ARM, X86, DSP general little endian mode  
»IBM, Sun, PowerPC general big-endian mode

## Code to Help Us Figure Out Whether my Computer is Little-Endian

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main1(void)
{
	int a = 0x11223344;
	char b;
	b = a;
	if(b==0x44)
		printf("Little endian!\n");
	else
		printf("Big endian!\n");
	return 0; 
} 

int main(void)
{
	union u{
		int a;
		char b;
	}c;
	c.a = 0x11223344;
	if(c.b==0x44)
		printf("Little endian!\n");
	else
		printf("Big endian!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

## Why are there big and small Endians?

• The little endian mode conforms to the thinking habits of how people: low address stores low byte data  
• Big-endian mode conforms to computer processing habits: no need to consider the corresponding relationship, according to the byte, the data is read and written directly from left to right, and in the order of address from low to high.  
• Big-endian mode is generally used in network byte order and various codecs
