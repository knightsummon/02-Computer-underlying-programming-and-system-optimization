# 7.14 OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism



## What is the OOP?

### Object-Oriented Programming

• Object Oriented Programming  
• Object is the basic unit of the program: including data members and functions (properties and methods)  
• Class: an abstraction of objective things, essentially a data type whose instances are objects

### Process Oriented Programming

• Procedure Oriented Programming  
• Function is the basic unit of a program: a step in solving a problem  
• Modular programming idea: program design from top to bottom and in units of function blocks

## Compare the Two

### Problem Solving Ideas

• Process-oriented: Focus on the steps, details, and module division of problem solving  
• Object-oriented: focuses on abstracting and encapsulating problems and designing the top-level architecture of the software  

### Applications

• Process-oriented: simple fixed function implementation, details: putting the elephant in the refrigerator  
• Object-oriented: Layer and system architecture design of complex software systems   

## The Three Characteristics of the Object Oriented Programming

### Three major characteristics

• Encapsulation: abstracting objective things into classes: properties and methods  
• Inheritance: Subclass objects possess the properties and methods of parent class objects  
• Polymorphism: multiple implementations of one interface: overriding and overloading  

```c++
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class Animal
	{
	public:
		int age;  //properties 
		int weight;
		Animal(void); // Constructor //类的构造函数 //The constructor is used to initialize objects of the Animal class. // Memory Aspect, allocate a real space on the memory.
 
		~Animal(void)  // Destructor //类的析构函数 //  to ensure proper cleanup  where objects are dynamically allocated and deallocated.
		{
			cout<<"~Animal()..."<<endl;
		} 
	    virtual void speak()
	 	{
	 		cout<<"Animal speaking..."<<endl;
	    }
		
	};
Animal::Animal(void) //  Animal::Animal(void) is using the :: operator to define a member function (Animal(void)) of the Animal class. //The "::" symbol is typically pronounced as "scope resolution operator" or simply "double colons"
{
	cout<<"Animal()..."<<endl;
}

class Cat:public Animal  // Sub Class: Parent Class // public Animal specifies that Cat is inheriting from the Animal class // The Operator ":" inheriting from  
{
	public: 
		char sex;
		Cat(void){cout<<"Cat()..."<<endl;} //Constructor 
		~Cat(void){cout<<"~Cat()..."<<endl;} //destructor
		void speak()
		{
			cout<<"cat speaking...miaomiao"<<endl;
		}
		void speak(char name[])
		{
			cout<<"cat speaking..."<<name<<endl;
		}
};


int main(void)
{
//	Animal animal;
//	animal.age = 1;
//	cout<<"animal.age:"<<animal.age<<endl;
//	animal.speak();
	
	Cat cat;
	Animal *p = &cat;
	cat.age = 2;
	cat.sex = 'F';
	cout<<"cat.age:"<<cat.age<<endl;
	cout<<"cat.sex:"<<cat.sex<<endl;
	p->speak();	
//	cat.speak();
//	cat.speak("xiaohua");			
	return 0;
} 
```

### Polymorphism

### Virtual Function

• Achievable or not  
• Implement polymorphism: Allow base class pointers to be used to call inheritance functions of subclasses  

### Pure Virtual Function

• Not implemented in parent class, must be implemented after subclass inherits  
• Implement interface  
• Abstract class  

## Object-oriented Programming Ideology has nothing to do with programming languages

• C++/Java implements the `class` keyword to better support object-oriented programming  
• C language can also implement object-oriented ideas through structures and function pointers

## How to learn the Linux kernel?

### Object-oriented thinking everywhere in the Linux kernel  

• Process-oriented analysis: registration, initialization, parameter setting, opening and closing, reading and writing
• Object-oriented analysis: code reuse, layering, framework…
