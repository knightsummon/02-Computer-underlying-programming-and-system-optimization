# 7.17 Object Oriented Programming on the Linux Kernel Inheritance (1)



## Inheritance

### What is inheritance?

•Several classes have something in common that can be extracted to form a parent class  
•Subclasses can directly use the properties and methods in the parent class

### Benefits of Inheritance

• Through inheritance, a multi-layered program structure is formed  
• Clear structure, clear hierarchy, easy to maintain  
• Improve code reusability

Why is there a constructor in C++?

What is the main function of the constructor?

 Constructors ensure that the object is set up correctly and is in a valid state for use. Here are the main functions of constructors in C++:

1. **Initialization:** The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the data members (attributes or variables) of an object to some initial values. It sets up the object's state, ensuring that it starts in a well-defined condition.
2. **Memory Allocation:** Constructors can also allocate memory if necessary. For example, in classes that manage dynamic memory (e.g., classes representing dynamic arrays or linked lists), the constructor may allocate memory for the object during its creation.
3. **Parameterization:** Constructors can accept arguments, allowing you to customize the initialization of objects. This allows you to create objects with different initial states based on the arguments passed to the constructor.
4. **Setting Defaults:** Constructors can provide default values for object attributes if no explicit values are provided during object creation. This helps ensure that objects have reasonable default settings when created without specifying all attributes.
5. **Resource Acquisition:** Constructors can be used for resource acquisition and management. For example, in the context of resource management classes (e.g., file handlers or network connections), constructors can be used to establish connections or acquire resources safely.
6. **Initialization of Complex Objects:** In cases where an object contains other objects or has complex initialization requirements, constructors help in ensuring that the entire object graph is properly initialized.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Constructor with no parameters (default constructor)
    MyClass() {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    // Constructor with parameters
    MyClass(int value) {
        // Initialization code using the provided value
    }
};
```

## Implementation of Inheritance ONE

### Embedded Structure

• There is a big difference between base class and subclass, first-level inheritance  
• Encapsulation through structure: subclass embeds parent class inside its structure  
• Then the subclass extends its own properties and methods based on the parent class  
• Subclass objects can freely reference the properties and methods of the parent class  

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define the base class (parent)
struct Shape {
    int x;
    int y;
};

// Define methods for the base class
void initializeShape(struct Shape *shape, int x, int y) {
    shape->x = x;
    shape->y = y;
}

// Define a method to print information about the shape
void printShapeInfo(struct Shape *shape) {
    printf("Shape at (%d, %d)\n", shape->x, shape->y);
}

// Define the subclass (child)
struct Circle {
    struct Shape base;  // Embed the base class inside the Circle
    int radius;
};

// Define methods for the Circle class
void initializeCircle(struct Circle *circle, int x, int y, int radius) {
    initializeShape(&(circle->base), x, y);  // Initialize the embedded base
    circle->radius = radius;
}

// Define a method to print information about the Circle
void printCircleInfo(struct Circle *circle) {
    printf("Circle at (%d, %d) with radius %d\n", circle->base.x, circle->base.y, circle->radius);
}

int main() {
    // Create a Circle object
    struct Circle myCircle;
    initializeCircle(&myCircle, 3, 4, 5);

    // Access and print properties of the Circle and its embedded Shape
    printCircleInfo(&myCircle);
    printShapeInfo(&(myCircle.base));  // Access the embedded base

    return 0;
}
```

## Implementation of Inheritance TWO

## Implementation of Inheritance THREE

### Abstract Class

• Classes containing pure virtual functions cannot be instantiated and can only be inherited by subclasses  
• Pure virtual function: The parent class does not implement it, leaving it to the subclass to implement polymorphism

### Abstract class function

• Implement the abstraction layer to manage the inheritance relationship between parent classes and subclasses  
• Improve code reusability through layering

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define the abstract class (or interface)
struct Shape {
    void (*printInfo)(const void*);  // Pure virtual function // void (*printInfo)(const void*); is a declaration that defines a function pointer named printInfo, which points to a function that takes a single argument of type const void* and returns nothing (void).
};

// Define a concrete class (subclass) that inherits from Shape
struct Circle {
    struct Shape base;  // Embed the Shape struct

    int radius;
};

// Implement the pure virtual function for Circle
void printCircleInfo(const void* obj) {
    const struct Circle* circle = (const struct Circle*)obj;
    printf("Circle with radius: %d\n", circle->radius);
}

int main() {
    // Create a Circle object
    struct Circle myCircle = {
        .base.printInfo = printCircleInfo,
        .radius = 5
    };

    // Call the "virtual" function on the Circle object
    myCircle.base.printInfo(&myCircle);

    return 0;
}
```
