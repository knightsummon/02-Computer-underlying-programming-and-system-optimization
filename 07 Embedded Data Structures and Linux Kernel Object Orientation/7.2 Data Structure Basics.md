# 7.2 Data Structure Basics



## Program = Data structure + Algorithm

1. **Data Structure:** Data structures are the containers or formats used to store and organize data in a program. They define how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated. Data structures can be as simple as arrays or as complex as graphs or databases. Choosing the right data structure is critical because it determines how efficiently you can perform various operations on the data. Different data structures are suitable for different types of data and operations.

   For example, if you need to store a list of items and frequently perform operations like adding, deleting, or accessing elements by index, you might choose an array or a linked list as the data structure.

Using a Singly Linked List in C to Store data:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Define a structure for a node in the linked list
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

// Function to create a new node
struct Node* createNode(int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    return newNode;
}

// Function to append a node to the linked list
void append(struct Node** head, int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = createNode(data);
    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = newNode;
    } else {
        struct Node* current = *head;
        while (current->next != NULL) {
            current = current->next;
        }
        current->next = newNode;
    }
}

// Function to delete a node by value
void deleteNode(struct Node** head, int value) {
    struct Node* current = *head;
    struct Node* prev = NULL;

    if (current != NULL && current->data == value) {
        *head = current->next;
        free(current);
        return;
    }

    while (current != NULL && current->data != value) {
        prev = current;
        current = current->next;
    }

    if (current == NULL) {
        return;
    }

    prev->next = current->next;
    free(current);
}

// Function to get the element at a specific index
int getElementAtIndex(struct Node* head, int index) {
    struct Node* current = head;
    int count = 0;
    while (current != NULL) {
        if (count == index) {
            return current->data;
        }
        current = current->next;
        count++;
    }
    return -1; // Index out of bounds
}

int main() {
    // Initialize an empty linked list
    struct Node* myLinkedList = NULL;

    // Append elements to the linked list
    append(&myLinkedList, 10);
    append(&myLinkedList, 20);
    append(&myLinkedList, 30);

    // Access elements by index
    int elementAtIndex1 = getElementAtIndex(myLinkedList, 1); // Accessing the second element (index 1)

    // Delete an element by value
    deleteNode(&myLinkedList, 20);

    // Print the linked list
    struct Node* current = myLinkedList;
    printf("Linked List: ");
    while (current != NULL) {
        printf("%d -> ", current->data);
        current = current->next;
    }
    printf("NULL\n");

    return 0;
}
```

2. **Algorithm:** Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of instructions that define how to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. Algorithms are independent of the data they operate on and focus on the logic and sequence of operations required to achieve a desired outcome. An efficient algorithm can significantly impact the performance of a program, regardless of the underlying data structure.

   For example, if you want to sort a list of items, you can choose from various sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or bubblesort. Each algorithm has different time and space complexity characteristics, which can affect the program's performance.

In summary, the equation "Program = data structure + algorithm" emphasizes that a well-designed computer program involves both selecting appropriate data structures to represent and manage the data and implementing efficient algorithms to process and manipulate that data. The choice of data structures and algorithms depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the performance requirements of your program. A good balance between the two elements is essential for creating effective and efficient software solutions.

## The Role of Data Structures in the kernel

```
Linked list: device management
Queue: work queue, waiting queue, message queue
Tree: binary tree, red-black tree, B-tree
Hash table: file system
```

## Linear Table (one to one)

• A sequence of N elements of the same data type  
• Each element has one and only one predecessor and successor

### Classification of the Linear Table
