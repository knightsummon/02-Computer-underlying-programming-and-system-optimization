## KFIFO

In the Linux Kernel, a queue is a data structure used to manage and store a collection of elements in a linear order. Queues are essential for many aspects of kernel operation, such as managing tasks, scheduling, and handling various types of data.

KFIFO (Kernel FIFO) is a specific type of queue implementation within the Linux Kernel. It is designed to efficiently handle First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures in a way that minimizes the need for memory allocations and deallocations, making it suitable for high-performance scenarios.

Here are some key characteristics and features of KFIFO in the Linux Kernel:

1. Lockless Design: KFIFO is designed to be used in multi-threaded or multi-core environments, so it employs a lockless design to minimize contention between threads or processes accessing the queue. This design can significantly improve performance in scenarios with high concurrency.
2. Preallocated Memory: Unlike some other queue implementations that dynamically allocate memory for each element added to the queue, KFIFO requires a fixed-size buffer to be allocated upfront. This preallocated memory ensures that no dynamic memory allocations or deallocations are needed when adding or removing elements from the queue, reducing overhead and improving performance.
3. Efficient Handling of Full and Empty States: KFIFO provides efficient mechanisms to handle situations when the queue is full or empty. For instance, when adding elements to a full KFIFO, it can overwrite the oldest elements (as it's a FIFO), allowing for continuous data streaming without blocking. Similarly, when trying to dequeue from an empty KFIFO, it can return an error code or block, depending on the configuration.
4. Configurable: KFIFO is configurable and can be adapted to specific use cases. You can specify the size of the preallocated buffer, the data type it stores, and the behavior when the queue is full or empty, making it versatile for different scenarios.
5. API and Macros: KFIFO provides a set of macros and functions that allow developers to interact with the queue efficiently. These macros include `kfifo_init`, `kfifo_put`, `kfifo_get`, and others, simplifying the integration of KFIFO into kernel code.

KFIFO is particularly useful in scenarios where data must be processed in a strict order and with minimal overhead. It's commonly used in kernel components that deal with data streams, such as network drivers, real-time systems, and various I/O subsystems. Its lockless design and efficient memory management make it a valuable tool for improving the performance and responsiveness of the Linux Kernel in these types of applications.

```c
struct kfifo {
    unsigned char *buffer;    /* the buffer holding the data */
    unsigned int size;    /* the size of the allocated buffer */
    unsigned int in;    /* data is added at offset (in % size) */
    unsigned int out;    /* data is extracted from off. (out % size) */
    spinlock_t *lock;    /* protects concurrent modifications */
};
```

buffer: cache used to store data

size: The size of the buffer space. When initializing, expand it upward to a power of 2.

lock: If the use cannot guarantee that there will be at most one reading thread and writing thread at any time, this lock needs to be used to implement synchronization.

in, out: together with buffer form a circular queue. in points to the head of the queue in the buffer, and out points to the tail of the queue in the buffer. Its structure is as shown below

```c
0                                                             mask
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|            |<----------data---------->|                      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
             ^                          ^                      ^
             |                          |                      |
            out                        in                     size
```

## KFIFO Enqueue

1. **Initialization (kfifo_init / kfifo_alloc)**:

   - `kfifo_init` is used to initialize a pre-allocated KFIFO structure. This function requires a pre-allocated KFIFO structure and a pointer to the data storage area. It associates the KFIFO structure with the data storage area.

     ```c
     /**
      * kfifo_init - initialize a fifo using a preallocated buffer
      * @fifo: the fifo to assign the buffer
      * @buffer: the preallocated buffer to be used
      * @size: the size of the internal buffer, this have to be a power of 2
      *
      * This macro initialize a fifo using a preallocated buffer.
      *
      * The numer of elements will be rounded-up to a power of 2.
      * Return 0 if no error, otherwise an error code.
      */
     #define kfifo_init(fifo, buffer, size) \
     ({ \
     	typeof((fifo) + 1) __tmp = (fifo); \
     	struct __kfifo *__kfifo = &__tmp->kfifo; \
     	__is_kfifo_ptr(__tmp) ? \
     	__kfifo_init(__kfifo, buffer, size, sizeof(*__tmp->type)) : \
     	-EINVAL; \
     })
     ```

     ![02](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/07%20Embedded%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Linux%20Kernel%20Object%20Orientation/7.11%20Queues%20in%20the%20Linux%20Kernel%20KFIFO%20(1).assets/02.jpg)

   - `kfifo_alloc` is a more advanced initialization function that dynamically allocates memory to store KFIFO data. You need to provide parameters such as the size of each data element and the desired capacity. This function dynamically allocates memory for both KFIFO data and control structures.

     ```c
     /**
      * kfifo_alloc - dynamically allocates a new fifo buffer
      * @fifo: pointer to the fifo
      * @size: the number of elements in the fifo, this must be a power of 2
      * @gfp_mask: get_free_pages mask, passed to kmalloc()
      *
      * This macro dynamically allocates a new fifo buffer.
      *
      * The numer of elements will be rounded-up to a power of 2.
      * The fifo will be release with kfifo_free().
      * Return 0 if no error, otherwise an error code.
      */
     #define kfifo_alloc(fifo, size, gfp_mask) \
     __kfifo_int_must_check_helper( \
     ({ \
     	typeof((fifo) + 1) __tmp = (fifo); \
     	struct __kfifo *__kfifo = &__tmp->kfifo; \
     	__is_kfifo_ptr(__tmp) ? \
     	__kfifo_alloc(__kfifo, size, sizeof(*__tmp->type), gfp_mask) : \
     	-EINVAL; \
     }) \
     )
     ```

     

2. **Enqueue (kfifo_put)**:

   - The `kfifo_put` function is used to add an element to the KFIFO. It requires a pointer to the pre-allocated KFIFO structure, the data element to insert, and a pointer to a lock (if needed). If the KFIFO is full (reached its capacity), the insertion operation may overwrite the oldest element, as KFIFO maintains a FIFO order. After a successful insertion, the KFIFO's pointer and count are updated to reflect the addition of the new element.

     ```c
      /**
      * kfifo_put - put data into the fifo
      * @fifo: address of the fifo to be used
      * @val: the data to be added
      *
      * This macro copies the given value into the fifo.
      * It returns 0 if the fifo was full. Otherwise it returns the number
      * processed elements.
      *
      * Note that with only one concurrent reader and one concurrent
      * writer, you don't need extra locking to use these macro.
      */
     #define	kfifo_put(fifo, val) \
     ({ \
     	typeof((fifo) + 1) __tmp = (fifo); \
     	typeof(*__tmp->const_type) __val = (val); \
     	unsigned int __ret; \
     	size_t __recsize = sizeof(*__tmp->rectype); \
     	struct __kfifo *__kfifo = &__tmp->kfifo; \
     	if (__recsize) \
     		__ret = __kfifo_in_r(__kfifo, &__val, sizeof(__val), \
     			__recsize); \
     	else { \
     		__ret = !kfifo_is_full(__tmp); \
     		if (__ret) { \
     			(__is_kfifo_ptr(__tmp) ? \
     			((typeof(__tmp->type))__kfifo->data) : \
     			(__tmp->buf) \
     			)[__kfifo->in & __tmp->kfifo.mask] = \
     				(typeof(*__tmp->type))__val; \
     			smp_wmb(); \
     			__kfifo->in++; \
     		} \
     	} \
     	__ret; \
     })
     ```

     

3. **Check for Available Space (kfifo_in / kfifo_in_spinlocked)**:

   - `kfifo_in` is used to check if there is enough free space to insert a specified number of elements into the KFIFO without actually inserting them. If sufficient space is available, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

     ```c
     /**
      * kfifo_in - put data into the fifo
      * @fifo: address of the fifo to be used
      * @buf: the data to be added
      * @n: number of elements to be added
      *
      * This macro copies the given buffer into the fifo and returns the
      * number of copied elements.
      *
      * Note that with only one concurrent reader and one concurrent
      * writer, you don't need extra locking to use these macro.
      */
     #define	kfifo_in(fifo, buf, n) \
     ({ \
     	typeof((fifo) + 1) __tmp = (fifo); \
     	typeof(__tmp->ptr_const) __buf = (buf); \
     	unsigned long __n = (n); \
     	const size_t __recsize = sizeof(*__tmp->rectype); \
     	struct __kfifo *__kfifo = &__tmp->kfifo; \
     	(__recsize) ?\
     	__kfifo_in_r(__kfifo, __buf, __n, __recsize) : \
     	__kfifo_in(__kfifo, __buf, __n); \
     })
     ```

     ![03](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/07%20Embedded%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Linux%20Kernel%20Object%20Orientation/7.11%20Queues%20in%20the%20Linux%20Kernel%20KFIFO%20(1).assets/03.jpg)

   - `kfifo_in_spinlocked` is a version of `kfifo_in` that operates under a spinlock to ensure atomic checking and insertion operations in a multi-threaded environment.

## KFIFO Dequeue

1. **Dequeue (Kfifo_get)**:

   - The `Kfifo_get` function is used to remove an element from the KFIFO and return its value. It requires a pointer to the pre-allocated KFIFO structure and a pointer to store the returned value. When you call this function, it removes an element from the head of the KFIFO and stores its value in the provided pointer. This operation decreases the number of elements in the KFIFO and moves the head pointer forward.

     ```c
     /**
      * kfifo_get - get data from the fifo
      * @fifo: address of the fifo to be used
      * @val: address where to store the data
      *
      * This macro reads the data from the fifo.
      * It returns 0 if the fifo was empty. Otherwise it returns the number
      * processed elements.
      *
      * Note that with only one concurrent reader and one concurrent
      * writer, you don't need extra locking to use these macro.
      */
     #define	kfifo_get(fifo, val) \
     __kfifo_uint_must_check_helper( \
     ({ \
     	typeof((fifo) + 1) __tmp = (fifo); \
     	typeof(__tmp->ptr) __val = (val); \
     	unsigned int __ret; \
     	const size_t __recsize = sizeof(*__tmp->rectype); \
     	struct __kfifo *__kfifo = &__tmp->kfifo; \
     	if (__recsize) \
     		__ret = __kfifo_out_r(__kfifo, __val, sizeof(*__val), \
     			__recsize); \
     	else { \
     		__ret = !kfifo_is_empty(__tmp); \
     		if (__ret) { \
     			*(typeof(__tmp->type))__val = \
     				(__is_kfifo_ptr(__tmp) ? \
     				((typeof(__tmp->type))__kfifo->data) : \
     				(__tmp->buf) \
     				)[__kfifo->out & __tmp->kfifo.mask]; \
     			smp_wmb(); \
     			__kfifo->out++; \
     		} \
     	} \
     	__ret; \
     }) \
     )
     ```

     

2. **Remove the Element (Kfifo_out)**:

   - `kfifo_out` is a macro used to get data from a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.

   - It takes three parameters:
   
     - `fifo`: The address of the FIFO to be used.
     - `buf`: A pointer to the storage buffer where the data will be copied.
     - `n`: The maximum number of elements to get from the FIFO.
   
   - 
   
     ```c
     /**
      * kfifo_out - get data from the fifo
      * @fifo: address of the fifo to be used
      * @buf: pointer to the storage buffer
      * @n: max. number of elements to get
      *
      * This macro get some data from the fifo and return the numbers of elements
      * copied.
      *
      * Note that with only one concurrent reader and one concurrent
      * writer, you don't need extra locking to use these macro.
      */
     #define	kfifo_out(fifo, buf, n) \
     __kfifo_uint_must_check_helper( \
     ({ \
     	typeof((fifo) + 1) __tmp = (fifo); \
     	typeof(__tmp->ptr) __buf = (buf); \
     	unsigned long __n = (n); \
     	const size_t __recsize = sizeof(*__tmp->rectype); \
     	struct __kfifo *__kfifo = &__tmp->kfifo; \
     	(__recsize) ?\
     	__kfifo_out_r(__kfifo, __buf, __n, __recsize) : \
     	__kfifo_out(__kfifo, __buf, __n); \
     }) \
     )
