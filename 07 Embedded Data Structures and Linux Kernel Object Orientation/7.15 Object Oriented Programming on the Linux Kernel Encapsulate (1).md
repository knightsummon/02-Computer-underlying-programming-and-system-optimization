# 7.15 Object Oriented Programming on the Linux Kernel: Encapsulate (1)



## Object Encapsulation in the C Language

### Use Structure to simulate a Class

• Structure  
• Function pointer  
• Structure pointer  

Question: the C language Struct can not adopt function (method) inside. As you can see, it becomes an Error.

We use Function Pointer to select function, using Function Pointer is a data type to avoid error.

### C Language: How to use `structure`to realize the `OOP:Inheritage`

![03](7.15 Object Oriented Programming on the Linux Kernel Encapsulate (1).assets/03.jpg)

```c
struct cat c;
//c.ani.age = 1;-------------->
//c.ani.weight = 2;-----------> c.p->&ani;
//c.ani.fp = speak;----------->
c.p = &ani;
c.p -> fp();
```

### OOP: Encapsulate

```c
#include<stdio.h>

void speak(void)
{
	printf("animal speaking...\n");
}
struct func_pointer{
	void (*fp1)(void);
	void (*fp2)(void);
	void (*fp3)(void);
	void (*fp4)(void);	
} 
struct animal{
	int age;
	int weight;
	struct func_pointer *fp;
};

struct cat{
	struct animal *p;
	struct animal ani;
	char sex; 
};

int main(void)
{
	struct animal ani;
	ani.age = 1;
	ani.weight = 2;
	ani.fp = speak;
	printf("%d %d\n",ani.age,ani.weight);
	ani.fp();
	
	struct cat c;
	c.p = &ani;
	c.p->fp();
	printf("%d %d\n",c.p->age,c.p->weight);
	
	
	return 0;
}

```

## Object-Oriented Ideology in the Linux Kernel

### Layering, encapsulation

• File systems: VFS, EXT, YAFFS, CRAMFS  
• Device driver model: device, driver, bus  
• Input subsystem: mouse, keyboard, remote control, motion sensor  
• MTD: block device reading and writing algorithms  
• Process Scheduling  
• Memory management  
• Network protocol stack  

## Data Encapsulation in the Linux Kernel

### Base class: Device management model

### Generate a Devices Tree

```c
struct kobject {
const char *name;
struct list_head entry; // This is a classic Linked List head for initialization
struct kobject *parent;
struct kset *kset;
struct kobj_type *ktype;
struct kernfs_node *sd;
struct kref kref;
unsigned int state_initialized:1;//---------------------->States, to show plugin, plugout 
unsigned int state_in_sysfs:1;
unsigned int state_add_uevent_sent:1;
unsigned int state_remove_uevent_sent:1;
unsigned int uevent_suppress:1;
};
```


The code you provided defines a C structure named `kobject`. This structure is commonly used in the Linux kernel to represent kernel objects in a hierarchical manner. Let's go through each of its members and explain their purposes:

1. `const char *name`: This member is a pointer to a constant character string (a C string) that represents the name of the kernel object. It is a human-readable identifier for the object.
2. `struct list_head entry`: This member is a part of a linked list data structure. It is used for maintaining a list of `kobject` instances, typically within a data structure called a `kset`. The linked list allows efficient traversal and management of these objects.
3. `struct kobject *parent`: This member points to the parent `kobject` in the hierarchy. It specifies the relationship between this object and its parent object.
4. `struct kset *kset`: This member points to the `kset` (kernel set) to which this `kobject` belongs. A `kset` is a container that group related kernel objects together.
5. `struct kobj_type *ktype`: This member points to a structure that defines various operations and attributes associated with the `kobject`. It specifies how the kernel should interact with this type of object.
6. `struct kernfs_node *sd`: This member points to a kernel filesystem (kernfs) node associated with the `kobject`. Kernfs is used to expose kernel objects and their attributes in the sysfs filesystem.
7. `struct kref kref`: This member is a reference counter. It helps manage the lifetime of the `kobject`. When objects are referenced, this counter is incremented, and when they are no longer needed, it is decremented. When the counter reaches zero, the object can be safely deallocated.
8. `unsigned int state_initialized:1`: This is a bitfield representing a flag that indicates whether the `kobject` has been initialized.
9. `unsigned int state_in_sysfs:1`: This is another bitfield flag that signifies whether the `kobject` is currently present in the sysfs filesystem. When set, it means that the object is exposed in sysfs.
10. `unsigned int state_add_uevent_sent:1`: This bitfield flag is used to track whether the "add" event has been sent for this `kobject`. In the context of the Linux kernel, "add" events are typically generated when a new device or object is added.
11. `unsigned int state_remove_uevent_sent:1`: Similar to the previous flag, this one is used to track whether the "remove" event has been sent for this `kobject`. "Remove" events are generated when a device or object is removed.
12. `unsigned int uevent_suppress:1`: This bitfield flag indicates whether uevent processing should be suppressed for this `kobject`. Uevents are a mechanism in the Linux kernel for notifying userspace applications about changes in device status.

### Kset: a Collection of kobjects of the Same Type

### Abstraction and Encapsulation of Linked Lists

```c
struct list_head{
    struct list_head *next, *prev;
};
```

• Different linked list nodes, different data formats
• Requires the same linked list operations
