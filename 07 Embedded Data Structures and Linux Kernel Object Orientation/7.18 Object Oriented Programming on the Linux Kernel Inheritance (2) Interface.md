# 7.18 Object Oriented Programming on the Linux Kernel Inheritance (2): Interface



## Interface

### What is the Interface?

A class including properties, methods.
After the object is encapsulated, the interface is reserved for use by other objects.

## Comparison Between Interface and Abstract Class

### Same Point

• Neither can be instantiated as an object  
• It’s all about achieving polymorphism  

### Difference

• Interface is an encapsulation of some methods and does not allow data members, Interface is not inherited by any subclasses. 
• Abstract classes are inherited by subclasses, and interfaces must be implemented by classes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// 定义一个结构体，表示类的数据成员
struct Shape {
    int x;
    int y;
};

// 定义一个函数指针类型，表示类的接口// *setLocation and *printLocation are Function Pointer to select the functions.
typedef struct { // Interface: only contains Methods
    void (*setLocation)(struct Shape* shape, int x, int y);
    void (*printLocation)(const struct Shape* shape);
} ShapeInterface;

// 定义一个函数，用于设置坐标
void setLocation(struct Shape* shape, int x, int y) {
    shape->x = x;
    shape->y = y;
}

// 定义一个函数，用于打印坐标
void printLocation(const struct Shape* shape) {
    printf("Shape at (%d, %d)\n", shape->x, shape->y);
}

int main() {
    // 创建一个结构体对象
    struct Shape myShape = {0, 0};

    // 创建一个接口对象，将函数指针与实际函数关联
    ShapeInterface shapeInterface = {  // Interface Class directly creates the Interface Object, and directly call the methods.
        .setLocation = setLocation,
        .printLocation = printLocation
    };

    // 使用接口调用函数
    shapeInterface.setLocation(&myShape, 3, 4);
    shapeInterface.printLocation(&myShape);

    return 0;
}

```

## Interface: Connects two Unrelated Classes

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a function pointer type for the interface
typedef void (*InterfaceFunction)(void); // Function Pointer used to select function, Polymorphism.

// Define structures representing two unrelated classes

struct ClassA {
    int data;
};

struct ClassB {
    char name[20];
};

// Define methods for Class A

void methodA_ClassA(struct ClassA *obj) {
    printf("Method A for Class A: Data = %d\n", obj->data);
}

// Define methods for Class B

void methodB_ClassB(struct ClassB *obj) {
    printf("Method B for Class B: Name = %s\n", obj->name);
}

int main() {
    // Create instances of Class A and Class B
    struct ClassA objectA = {42};
    struct ClassB objectB = {"John"};

    // Create an interface that connects the classes through function pointers
    // Polymorphism, when Select the methodA, interface access the ClassA, Same to ClassB.
    InterfaceFunction interfaceA = (InterfaceFunction)methodA_ClassA;
    InterfaceFunction interfaceB = (InterfaceFunction)methodB_ClassB;

    // Use the interface to call methods on unrelated classes
    printf("Using interface for Class A:\n");
    interfaceA(&objectA);

    printf("\nUsing interface for Class B:\n");
    interfaceB(&objectB);

    return 0;
}
```

## USB Network Card Driver

At every Level of Objects, it self implement extension, which you can see it as a interacts. For example, the Network Card Device Object inheriting from `Device Object` and `Kobject Object` , It also add the interacts like `struct net_device_ops` to implement own features.

![02](7.18 Object Oriented Programming on the Linux Kernel Inheritance (2) Interface.assets/02.jpg)

Such as `(*node_open)` is a function pointer to select specific function.

**You can also see those function pointer as Pure Virtual Class to call different methods from various Classes.**

As you can see, There are Various Network Card manufactured by multiple companies, the Polymorphism , implemented by `struct net_device_ops`, adapts to the different configurations Network Cards.

All Devices in Linux are Files.
