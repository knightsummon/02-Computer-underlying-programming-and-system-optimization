# 3.3 Pre-Processing



## The Process of Pre-Processing

•Header file expansion: Insert the files included in #include into the directive position
• Macro Expansion: Expands all macro definitions and removes #define
•Conditional Compilation: Handles all conditional precompiled directives: #if, #ifdef, #else, #endif
• Delete comments
•Add line number and file name identification: display line number information when compiling and debugging
• Preserve #pragma commands

## Why do we need Pre-processing

Conditional compilation
	Compatible with each platform, the processor architecture(X86, ARM)
	Maximize the reuse of common code
The header file contains
	Modular programming

## Main.c and Main.i

```
$gcc --verbose -E main.c >main.i
```

## #pragma Pre-Processing Command Line

Use: **#pragma** is the command line that orders the compiler to do specific operation.

Use Format
• #pragma pack([n]): Indicates the alignment of structure and union members
•#pragma message(“string”): print text information in compilation information output window
•#pragma warning: selectively change the behavior of compiler warning messages
•#pragma once: Add this instruction in the header file to prevent the header file from being compiled multiple times
