# 3.8 Linking: Strong Symbol and Weak Symbol



When Multiple person work together, There may be same names exists in the Project. Just like the Variable a.

## The concept of symbols

Strong symbols
	•Function name
	• Initialized global variables
Weak symbols
	• Uninitialized global variables



## Compiler's handling rules for symbols

### Strong symbols

​	• Strong symbols are not allowed to be defined multiple times, but strong and weak symbols can coexist
​	• When strong and weak Symbols coexist, the strong Symbol overwrites the weak Symbol, and the strong symbol will be selected when linking

### Weak symbols

​	• The compiler allows multiple weak symbols
​	• During compilation, the **compiler** does not know the size of the space occupied by the weak symbol, put the weak symbol in the common block, and use an undefined COMMOM to mark it
​	• During linking, the **linker** compares weak symbols in multiple files and chooses the one that takes up the most space



## Weak Symbol and .BSS Section

### The BSS Section in different phase of Object files

Before relocate: The relocatable object file has not yet been linked, and the uninitialized global variable is not placed in the .BSS segment, but placed in the .COMMON temporary block, because it has not been determined which one to use

After relocate: The executable object file has been linked, the weak symbol selection has been determined, and a maximum space is allocated and placed in the .BSS segment

Because the i in the main.o and sub.o is both weak, linker chooses the max size symbol to avoid memory collision.

The Variable " i " finally put into the Section 24  **.bss**



## Strong Symbol Convert into Weak Symbol

### GCC Compiler Expansion Keywords: __attribute__

```
__attribute__((weak)) int n = 100;
__attribute__((weak)) void fun();
```



## Strong Reference and Weak Reference

​	The essence of a symbol is an memory address  
​	Strong symbols correspond to strong references, weak symbols correspond to weak references

### features

​	If the symbol reference is a strong reference and its definition cannot be found during linking, an error will be reported
​	If the symbol reference is a weak reference, the symbol is undefined, no error will be reported when linking, and an error will be reported when running the program
​	We can judge whether to execute this function according to whether the symbol reference is 0

## Applications of Weak References

### library

​	• We can customize functions to override functions in the library and use custom versions of library functions
​	• Define the references of some extended function modules as weak references: When we delete some extended function modules, the program can also be linked and run normally

### Multi Threads

​	The program under Linux defines the **pthread_create** function as a **weak reference**. When running, it determines whether the link is a **single-threaded** **glibc library** or a **multi-threaded glibc library**. The system decides whether to enable the single-threaded mode or the multi-threaded mode for the program.

**Example**

File a.out  
Symbol table '.symtab' contains 67 entries:

As you can see, the address is allocate a memory value.

00001060 is where the .text segment begin, 000000000000117a is where the weak symbol start.

The weak symbol (library) is override by void decode(void). Imagine the decode.h is a file provided by company, you as a employee writes a customized decode to run specified function. __attribute__((weak)) allows your code directly cover the standard library code without confliction.
