# 3.6  Symbol Table



## Symbol table

### Symbol table

​	• During the compilation process, the symbol table is used to save the information of various symbols in the source program
​	•Mainly include the address value, type, and size of the occupied space of the symbol

### The role of the symbol table

​	• Auxiliary semantic check: Check whether the source program has semantic errors
​	• Auxiliary code generation: address and space allocation, symbol resolution, relocation

## ELF files and BIN files

### File structure

•BIN file is raw binary file
	– Contains only machine code, pure program files, ie image files  
	– Similar to HEX files  
• The ELF file has some additional information besides the machine code  
	– Section load address, _Start address  
	– Symbol table, relocation table, etc.  
•Operation mode  
	**BIN file** to run, just load it to the link address
	**ELF file** operation requires OS environment and loader (loader, ld-linux.so)



## Data Structure of Symbol Table

Literally, The **Symbol Table** is a structured array.

$cd linux/arch/arm/include/asm/elf.h

```
typedef struct elf32_sym{ 
	Elf32_Word st_name; //符号名，字符串表中的索引 // The names of Variables
	Elf32_Addr st_value; //符号对应的值 //The Addresses of Variables
	Elf32_Word st_size; //符号大小，如int类型数据符号=4 //The Size of data type
	unsigned char st_info; //符号类型和绑定信息 //Information about Character
	unsigned char st_other; 
	Elf32_Half st_shndx; //符号所在的段 //The Section of the Symbol
} Elf32_Sym;
```

## Symbol values and symbol types

### symbolic value

• Essentially an address
» Relative addresses: in relocatable objects file
» Absolute addresses: in executable object file

### symbol type

• Object: Indicates the size of the storage space occupied by the **data type**
• Function: the size of the space occupied by the **instructions**

### Symbol Type

| OBJECT  | The symbol is associated with a data object: variable, array or pointer |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FUNC    | A symbol is associated with a function or procedure          |
| SECTION | symbol associated to another section name                    |
| FILE    | symbol associated with another filename                      |
| NOTYPE  | symbol has no type                                           |

### Bind

| LOCAL  | Local symbol, visible in the object file. Multiple files with the same name do not conflict |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GLOBAL | Called by multiple files over a Project                      |
| WEAK   | **Weak symbols**, visible to the entire program, can be defined repeatedly in multiple files. Even if the weak symbol is undefined, the linker does not report an error, and the symbol value is set to 0 |



## Section Table

## Generation of symbol table

• Compile phase
	Lexical analysis: Encounter a newly declared variable name, function name, add to the symbol table
	Parsing: fills in information about the symbol table
	Semantic analysis: check the semantic correctness according to the symbol table
	Assembly stage: the assembler will scan the assembly source file to generate symbol tables
• link phase
	After merging each object file and libraries, relocate the address of each symbol in the symbol table, then generate the executable file.

## Purpose of Symbol Table and Relocate Table

• Provide necessary information for subsequent link and operation process  
• The **linker** performs linking and relocation all symbols according to the relocation table and symbol table to generate executable files that can run (like a.out)  
• The **loader** loads the program into the specified memory to run according to the file header and program header information
