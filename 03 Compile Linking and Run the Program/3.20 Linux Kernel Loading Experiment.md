# 3.20 Linux Kernel Loading Experiment



## Linux Kernel Boot

### U-boot bootload 

• Support **TFTP, NAND, NOR, SD car**d and other boot methods (U-boot Stored on them)  
• U-boot uses **bootm** to guide **uImage**  
• Boot zImage using **bootz**  

TFTP is download files from Server online.

## Experiment

### lab environment

• Hardware environment: ARM vexpress A9 virtual development board  
• RAM configuration: 512M  
• RAM physical address: **0x60000000~0x7FFFFFFF**  

### Kernel boot-load

•Set uImage loading address to 0x60003000, compile and generate uImage  
• Load the kernel to address 0x60003000, then bootm 0x60003000  
• Load the kernel to address 0x60004000, then bootm 0x60004000  



## The Kernel Image Compilation Process

## Several Key Addresses for Kernel Compilation

| Symbol      | Explanation                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LOADADDR    | uImage specifies the loading address, and u-boot loads uImage to the address of RAM |
| PHYS_OFFSET | Starting address of RAM physical memory: 0x60000000          |
| PAGE_OFFSET | Kernel virtual memory space starting address: generally 0xC0000000, **3G user space** + **1G kernel space**. On the vexpress development board platform, it is 0x80000000<br/>There is generally a linear mapping between virtual memory and physical memory: VA = PA + OFFSET<br/>This value is configurable via Kconfig, mapped to PHYS_OSSFET |
| TEXT_OFFSET | The kernel start address is offset relative to the RAM address, generally 0x8000, which is the same in both physical memory and virtual memory space. Defined in arch/arm/Makefile |
| TEXTADDR    | The virtual address of the kernel image startup: TEXT_ADDR=PAGE_OFFSET + TEXT_OFFSET<br/>This address is used as the link address when the kernel is compiled: 0x80008000 |
| ZRELADDR    | The physical address where the kernel image starts, zImage starts to decompress the real kernel code to this address, and then jumps here to execute. 0x60008000<br/>__virt_to_phys(TEXTADDR) = ZRELADDR |
| ZTEXTADDR   | zImage runs at the physical address. If LOADADDR is not defined, u-boot will download uImage to this address. The address space can be RAM or NOR FLASH address space |

## uImage Production

### From zImage to uImage  

• Nothing changes, just add a 0x40 byte data header  
• Record loading address, entry address, file size, CPU architecture and other information  

### mkimagetools

• The tool is located in the tools directory of the u-boot source code and is used to make a boot image file  

```
$ mkimage –A arm -O linux –T kernel –C none –a 0x60003000 –e 0x60003000 -d zImage uImage
```

• -A: CPU architecture  
• -O: operating system  
•-T: Specify the image type  
•-C: Use compression methods: none, gzip, bzip2  
•-a: Kernel load address  
•-e: Kernel entry address  

## U-boot Bootm

Bootm is a tool used to make Linux Image Kernel starting to operate.

Extract the head from the parameter address, copy the kernel image **zImage** with the head removed, then go to the loading address specified by -a, and then execute.  

## Two Conditions When Loading

### Loading Address equals Pre-specified Address

![07](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/03%20Compile%20Linking%20and%20Run%20the%20Program/3.20%20Linux%20Kernel%20Loading%20Experiment.assets/07.jpg)

### Loading Address not equals Pre-specified Address

## Inside the zImage

## zImage Decompression

![10](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/03%20Compile%20Linking%20and%20Run%20the%20Program/3.20%20Linux%20Kernel%20Loading%20Experiment.assets/10.jpg)

## Image Relocation

![11](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/03%20Compile%20Linking%20and%20Run%20the%20Program/3.20%20Linux%20Kernel%20Loading%20Experiment.assets/11.jpg)

Because the Image, after decompressing, is located at a virtual address and it needs to relocate to the physic address.
