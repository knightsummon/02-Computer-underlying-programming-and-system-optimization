# 3.10 Program Running



In the operating system environment: the executable ELF file runs
Bare metal environment: BIN/HEX file operation



## Executable ELF Files

### Loader

• Executing an executable file in the operating system environment, the loader will first load the executable file into memory  
• After the loader finishes copying the data, perform relevant operations, and then the program **PC** jumps to the program entry (memory address) to run the program.  

### Image Loading Address

The ELF file header contains basic information describing the entire ELF file, and the program header table contains loading information describing each segment in the executable file. These two data structures provide important information that the operating system needs when loading and mapping executable files in order to properly load the file into memory and execute it.
ELF文件头包含了描述整个ELF文件的基本信息，而程序头表包含了描述可执行文件中各个段的加载信息。这两个数据结构提供了操作系统在加载和映射可执行文件时所需的重要信息，以便正确地将文件加载到内存并执行。

## Program Header Table

Record how the loader of the operating system loads the executable file into the memory, the segment being loaded, and the entry address. A program segment may contain several sections

## LINUX Loads and Runs the Files

• Linux process
		Under the Linux environment, the loader can be started by calling the **execve** function. Executable files run in the form of processes
• When running an executable file, there are three main steps:
	– Create an independent virtual address space
	– Read the **header of the executable file** and establish the mapping relationship between the virtual address space and the executable file
	– Set the **PC** pointer to the entry address of the executable file and start running

## The memory image of the executable file when it is running

### Memory Allocation

• Text Segment:
	– Start at address 0x8048000
• Data Segment:
	– the next 4KB aligned address
• Heap: The address dynamically applied by program using **"malloc()"** and **"free()"** 
	– At the first 4K aligned address after the .bss section

## Program Entry

• X86, link address at compile time = run address
	The loader will read the ELF file header and find the program entry address
• Embedded: program entry address = link address + certain offset



## Here comes the problem...

• The link address of each program is 0x08048000 (GCC Default)
• Running many programs (processes) in one system
• Why is there **no address conflict**?



## MMU

Memory Management Unit

![07](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/03%20Compile%20Linking%20and%20Run%20the%20Program/3.10%20Program%20Running.assets/07.jpg)

Virtual Address VS Physical Address
	• CPU pin address signal: physical address
	• The pin signal of the CPU gets the virtual address after being processed by the MMU, and the operating system runs the virtual address
Purpose of MMU
	•Virtual memory, through the swap partition, you can run programs larger than the actual physical memory. The swap partition is called "**pagefile.sys**" hidden on the Windows 11 C drive. This file is generated during the installation  of the Operation System.
	• Memory protection: you can set the read and write permissions of different memory blocks
