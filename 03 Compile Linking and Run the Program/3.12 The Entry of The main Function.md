# 3.12 The Entry of The main Function



## Find the real entrance of the program

### Compiler's regulations on program entry

• The default program entry of the compiler is the **_start** symbol, not main.  
• The symbol **main** is a symbol called by the C standard library, which is used to tell the compiler where is the entry point of the program in a project.  
•Programmers follow this convention and use the **main** function as the entry point of the project program.  

### What We Should do Before Execute Main

• Set the stack pointer  
• Initialize "static" static variables and "global" global variables, that is, the content of the data segment  
• BSS segment initial value assignment: int family is initialized to 0, bool=FALSE, pointer=null  
• Pass the main function parameters **argc, argv,** etc. to main, and then start running **main**

## CRT 

•C running time: C runtime library  
	– Implement various library functions according to the C standard  
	–Complete a series of initialization operations into the main function  
		• The basic stack environment and process environment of C running  
		•Loading and release, initialization, cleaning, etc. of dynamic libraries  
		**•Pass parameters to the main function and call the main function**  
		• After the main function return exits (return 0), call the **exit** function  
	– Leave it to the programmer Programming the default interface: **main**

## Entry Main function difference

• Different compiler environments have slightly different C library implementations of the entry main name.  
• The programming interface for programmers is not necessarily main  
• Windows win32 window program: WinMain  
• Windows DLL program: DLLMain  
• Visual Studio environment: _tmain  
•QT entry: main  



## Specify the Program Entry Name by Yourself

```shell
$ gcc -nostartfiles –e <入口函数> xx.c //不链接标准启动文件 // Specify where is the Selfdefine _start
$ gcc -nostdlib //不链接标准启动文件和标准库文件
```

EG:

Create a file named mymain.c to instead main

```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int mymain()
{
	printf("mymain...\n");
	exit(0);
}
```

**$gcc -nostartfiles -e mymain mymain.c**

mymain() becomes the new start entry for the program.
