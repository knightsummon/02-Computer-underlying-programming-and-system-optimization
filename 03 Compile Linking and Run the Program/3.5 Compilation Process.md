## Generate Instructions

## How Source File Forms the Object File

![03](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/03%20Compile%20Linking%20and%20Run%20the%20Program/3.5%20Compilation%20Process.assets/03.jpg)

If we link multiple object files together, we should make a **relocate table** for compiler to link these character  in character table.

## Symbol Table

Collection of all Variable in the program.

![04](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/03%20Compile%20Linking%20and%20Run%20the%20Program/3.5%20Compilation%20Process.assets/04-1690302631384-4.jpg)

For row 9, the symbol is named "add," and it is a function (FUNC). The "Value" is `0000000000000000`, which means the symbol starts at the memory address 0. The "Size" is `24`, indicating that the function "add" occupies 24 bytes in memory.

For row 10, the symbol is named "sub," and it is also a function (FUNC). The "Value" is `0000000000000018`, which means the symbol starts at the memory address 0x18 (24 in decimal). The "Size" is `22`, indicating that the function "sub" occupies 22 bytes in memory.

So the Value (0x) is been see as the offset of variable in the Symbol table.

## Relocate Table

For **main.o**, it now still do not know where to find the add, sub, mul, div before linking, So assembler save these unknown Symbol to the relocate table and waiting for linker to linking. If after linking, they are still not found, the Compiler will stop and give out warnings.

Sym.Value is temperately given as 0x(0) to wait to handled by the linker.
