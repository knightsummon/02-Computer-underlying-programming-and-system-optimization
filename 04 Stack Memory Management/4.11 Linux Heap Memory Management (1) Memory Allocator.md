# 4.11 Linux Heap Memory Management (1) Memory Allocator



## Dynamic Memory Application and Release

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(void)
{
	int *p;
	p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*100);
	........................
	free(p);
	return 0;
}
```



## Linux Heap Address Space and Size

### Heap Space

• Linux2.4 allocates space to the shared library from **0x40000000**, and loads the program into this space  
• Linux2.6+ moves the shared library address up to near the stack, near **0xBFxxxxxx**

### Heap Size

• Theoretically about 2.9G virtual address space  (the green area for heap to use)

### Is mmap Used to Manage the Mapping Area of Memory?

mmap (Memory Mapping) is a mechanism provided by the operating system **to create a virtual memory mapping area** (Free Mapping Area) in the address space of a process in order to map files or other resources on the disk into memory. In this way, the content of these files can be accessed through the memory address without directly performing traditional read and write operations.

### MMAP Working Style

Mapping Files into Memory: With mmap, you can map files into the virtual memory address space of a process. This means that the contents of the file will be read into memory, but not all loaded into memory at once, but paged as needed.  

Lazy Loading: Memory-mapped regions are usually loaded on demand, that is, only when a specific memory page is accessed, the operating system will load the corresponding file content into memory. This way reduces startup time and saves memory.  

Direct Access: Once the file is mapped into memory, you can directly access the contents of the file by manipulating the memory address, just like accessing ordinary memory. This provides more efficient access because no additional read or write operations are required.  

Sharing with Memory: Multiple processes can map the same file to their own memory space, so as to realize sharing between processes. This is useful in scenarios where the contents of large files need to be shared.

## Heap Management Strategy

### System Call

• Linux is responsible for the authority management and address translation of the entire virtual address space by the kernel  
• The Underlying Implementation of malloc/free: apply for memory from the kernel through system calls  
• A large number of system calls can reduce performance

## Glibc Heap Memory Management

### Memory Allocator

• Glibc uses ptmalloc2 as the default memory allocator to manage heap memory  
• Reserve APIs such as malloc/free for application allocation of user dynamic memory  
• "wholesale" memory to the kernel through the system call brk/mmap  
• Manage free memory released by user programs

## Two Types of Dynamic Memory Management

• GLIBC Heap Memory: manage and reclaim memory blocks of different sizes through algorithms  
• MMAP Memory: request/release memory (>128K) to the system through system calls
