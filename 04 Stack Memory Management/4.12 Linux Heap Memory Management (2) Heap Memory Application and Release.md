# 4.12 Linux Heap Memory Management (2) Heap Memory Application and Release



## Heap Memory Application and Release 

**堆内存申请（分配）：**

1. **系统调用：** 程序通过系统调用（如`malloc()`、`new`等）来请求一块特定大小的堆内存。这些系统调用通常由标准库提供，然后标准库再调用操作系统的相关函数。  
2. **内存分配器：** 操作系统内部有一个内存分配器，它维护了一张表格，记录了哪些内存块是已使用的，哪些是空闲的。这个分配器的实现可以是不同的，如伙伴系统、slab分配器等。  
3. **空闲内存搜索：** 当请求内存时，内存分配器会在空闲内存中搜索足够大小的块来满足请求。搜索可能采用不同的算法，如首次适应、最佳适应、最坏适应等。  
4. **分配：** 一旦找到合适的空闲块，内存分配器会标记该块为已使用，并返回指向该块的指针。此时，该块不再被视为空闲内存。  

**Heap Memory Allocation:**

1. **System Calls:** Programs use system calls (such as `malloc()`, `new`, etc.) to request a specific size of heap memory. These system calls are typically provided by the standard library, which then invokes relevant functions in the operating system.
2. **Memory Allocator:** The operating system has an internal memory allocator that maintains a table, indicating which memory blocks are in use and which are free. The implementation of this allocator can vary, using mechanisms like the buddy system, slab allocator, and others.
3. **Free Memory Search:** When memory is requested, the memory allocator searches through free memory to find a suitable block to fulfill the request. The search can employ different algorithms, such as first fit, best fit, worst fit, and more.
4. **Allocation:** Once a suitable free block is found, the memory allocator marks it as used and returns a pointer to that block. At this point, the block is no longer considered free memory.

**堆内存释放（回收）：**

1. **系统调用：** 程序通过系统调用（如`free()`、`delete`等）来释放先前分配的堆内存。同样，这些调用通常由标准库提供。
2. **内存回收器：** 释放内存并不一定立即将内存返回给操作系统。内存分配器可能会维护一个空闲内存池，以便将稍后的内存分配请求满足。这样做可以减少频繁地与操作系统进行交互，提高性能。
3. **合并空闲块：** 内存回收器会尝试将相邻的空闲内存块合并为更大的块。这有助于减少内存碎片化，并使大块空闲内存可用于后续的大内存分配请求。
4. **标记为可用：** 一旦内存块被释放，内存分配器会将其标记为可用状态，以便将来的内存分配请求可以使用它。

**Heap Memory Deallocation:**

1. **System Calls:** Programs use system calls (such as `free()`, `delete`, etc.) to release previously allocated heap memory. Similarly, these calls are often provided by the standard library.
2. **Memory Reclaimer:** Releasing memory doesn't necessarily immediately return it to the operating system. The memory allocator might maintain a pool of free memory to satisfy later memory allocation requests. This can reduce the frequency of interactions with the operating system and enhance performance.
3. **Merging Free Blocks:** The memory reclaimer attempts to merge adjacent free memory blocks into larger blocks. This helps mitigate memory fragmentation and makes larger blocks of free memory available for subsequent larger memory allocation requests.
4. **Mark as Available:** Once a memory block is deallocated, the memory allocator marks it as available for future use in memory allocation requests.

## CHUNK

The memory requested by malloc is represented by a malloc_chunk structure   

Structure Definition: Glibc/malloc/malloc.c

## Allocated Chunks

### Flag Bit:

A: =0 means to allocate memory from the main arena (Memory used by same process); = 1 to allocate memory from the non-main arena (Memory used by different processes)  
M: =0 means allocate memory from Heap; =1 means allocate memory from MMAP mapping area  
P: =0 means the previous chunk is free

## Free Chunk

The memory block released by free will not be returned to the operating system immediately Add it to a linked list, readying for next time memory application, find a suitable free memory block from this linked list and allocate it to the user.

## bins

### Bin Definition

Bins is a linked list of all freed chunks.  

In the context of memory allocators and memory management systems, "bins" refers to data structures used to categorize and organize freed memory blocks of varying sizes. These bins are used to efficiently manage memory allocation and deallocation. The term "bins" is derived from the concept of grouping and storing objects or data in separate containers based on specific characteristics.

### Chunk Container

• The chunks freed by the user are connected into a linked list through pointers  
• Chunks of different sizes are connected into different **linked lists**, which are called **bins**  
• Ptmalloc has a total of 128 bins, use an array to save the starting addresses of these bins    

### Bin Classification

• Fast bins: The chunks that are freed and smaller than max_fast are first put here  
• Unsorted bins: chunks larger than max_fast or chunks merged in fastbins  
• Small bins: chunks smaller than 512 bytes  
• Large bins: 512B < SIZE <128K

**Fast Bins:**

- **Description:** Fast bins are a subset of bins specifically designed to quickly handle small memory allocations and deallocations. They are usually used for memory chunks smaller than a certain threshold size.  
- **Purpose:** The primary purpose of fast bins is to optimize the allocation and deallocation of small memory blocks. By keeping frequently used small chunks in fast bins, memory allocation and deallocation operations can be very fast, as they don't require extensive processing.  
- **Operations:** Memory chunks in fast bins are usually allocated and deallocated without much additional bookkeeping overhead. This is why they are "fast."  

**Regular Bins:**

- **Description:** Regular bins are used to store memory chunks of varying sizes, typically larger than those found in fast bins.  
- **Purpose:** Regular bins are responsible for managing a wider range of memory block sizes. They are designed to handle larger memory allocations efficiently and manage the memory fragmentation that might occur with larger memory chunks.  
- **Operations:** Memory chunks in regular bins might involve more complex bookkeeping due to the need to manage larger, more varied sizes of memory blocks.  



## Special Chunk

### Top Chunk

• An independent chunk at the top of a memory area, which does not belong to any bin  
• If the user requests < top chunk, the top chunk will be split, and the rest will be the new top chunk  
• If the user requests > top chunk, expand the top chunk through the system call sbrk/mmap

### Last Remainder Chunk

• When the memory block in the Large bin is larger than the user request, it will be divided  
• A part is returned to the user, and the rest is put into the unsorted bin  
• This remaining block is the new Last remainder chunk  

### mmap chunk

• When the user applies for memory greater than M_MMAP_THRESHOLD (**128KB**), it will apply for memory through the system call "**mmap**"  
• When the user is free, return it to the operating system through the system call "**unmmap**"  
• Note: the chunk will not be placed in the bin

## arena

### Allocation area

• The heap area allocated for threads through sbrk and mmap  
• main arena: the arena allocated to the main thread  
• thread arena: the arena allocated to the child thread (no-main thread)
