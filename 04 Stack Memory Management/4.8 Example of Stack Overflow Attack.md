```
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);
```

- `ptr`: This is a pointer to the memory location where the data read from the file will be stored. In your case, it's `a`, which is presumably an array or a pointer to a memory location where you want to store the data.  
- `size`: This parameter specifies the size (in bytes) of each element to be read from the file. In your case, it's `4`, which indicates that each element being read is 4 bytes in size.  
- `count`: This parameter specifies the number of elements to read from the file. In your case, it's `9`, which means you want to read a total of 9 elements from the file.  
- `stream`: This is a pointer to the `FILE` structure that represents the file you want to read from. In your case, it's `fp`, which is presumably a file pointer pointing to the file you want to read from.
