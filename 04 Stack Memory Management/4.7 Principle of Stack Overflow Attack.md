# 4.7 Principle of Stack Overflow Attack

### The maintenance process of the function call stack:

1. When a function is called, the current function's local variables and return address and other information will be pushed onto the stack.    
2. The function starts executing, local variables are used, and control flow proceeds to another function call or return statement.  
3. When the function returns, the information that was previously pushed onto the stack is popped, restoring the state of the calling function, including returning to the correct address.

### The laxity of the C language on bounds checking:

The C language is relatively loose when dealing with arrays and pointers. It does not automatically check array boundaries, which can easily lead to buffer overflows. For example, if a programmer does not properly verify that an array index is outside the bounds of the array, malicious input data may cause data overflow, overwrite data in adjacent memory regions, or even modify critical information on the stack.

```
#include<stdio.h>
void shellcode(void)
{
	printf("virus run success!\n");
	while(1);
}
void f(void)
{
	int a[4];
	int tmp;
	a[8] = shellcode;
	tmp = a[4];  //a[4] is the Security symbol for Compiler Safety Check
	a[4] = 3;
	printf("a[6] = %d\n",a[6]);  // Stole Password
	a[4] = tmp; //Give back the Security Symbol, Avoiding alert.
}

int main(void)
{
	f();
	printf("hello world!\n");
	return 0;
}
```
