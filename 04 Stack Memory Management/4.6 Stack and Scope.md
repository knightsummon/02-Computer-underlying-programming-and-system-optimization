# 4.6 Stack and Scope



## Variable Scope

### Global Variable

• The variable is defined outside the function:  
• Scope: from declaration to end of file  
• Other files can be referenced by using the extern declaration.  
• Life cycle: during the entire program operation  

### local variable

• Variables are defined in the function body and stored in the stack  
• Scope: can only be used within a function  
• Lifecycle: during function execution

## Why can't a program access local variables in other functions?

• Local variables will only allocate memory space in the stack when the function is called  
• The scope and lifetime of local variables are only exist during the execution of the function  
• **The function ends, the stack frame is released, and the variable "disappears"**  

 **Local Variables** are typically stored in the stack frame of a function's execution context. When a function is called, a new stack frame is created on the call stack to store information about the function's local variables, parameters, return address, and other relevant data.

## Scope Management

### Compiler stack management

• The compiler pushes and pops the stack according to {}  
• **Limit the scope of a variable according to {}**

## Summary

### Scope of global variables

• The scope of global variables is limited by the file  
• **Extern** can be used to expand and be referenced by other files
• **Static** can be used for restriction and can only be referenced in this document

### Scope of local variables

• The scope of local variables is delimited by {}  
• You can use static to modify the storage properties of local variables (life cycle)  
• but cannot change its scope

## **Variables decorated with static usually have the following characteristics:**

**Static variables are initialized only once**: Static variables are initialized only once during the lifetime of the program. This means that no matter how many times you call the function containing the static variable, the initialization of the variable will only happen on the first call.  

**Retain state: Static** variables retain their value between function calls. This means that when the function exits and is called again, the value of the static variable will be preserved instead of being reset.
