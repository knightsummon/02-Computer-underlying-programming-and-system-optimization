# 4.9 Heap Management: Memory Application and Release



## Heap

• Malloc dynamically allocated memory area
• Can be dynamically scaled up or down

## Difference Between Heap and Stack

• The content in the heap is anonymous and cannot be directly accessed by name, but indirectly accessed through pointers  
• The data and variables on the stack will be released when the function returns and cannot be used anymore  
• The heap memory is applied and released by the programmer (malloc/free). When the function exits, if the programmer does not release it, it will always exist

## Heap Memory Application and Release

### C language: malloc/free

### C++ language: new/delete

```c++
MyObject* myObject = new MyObject();
// Create New Object "myObject"
delete myObject; // Release the Memory in Heap
```



## Embedded Bare Metal Environment Heap Management

### Using C library functions  

• malloc/free (stdlib.h)  

### Heap size and initialization

• Keil's own startup file start_xx.s will initialize the heap and set the size of the heap  
• **_main uses __user_initial_stackheap** to get the stack address  
• Heap space address setting:  
	– Acquired by the compiler by default, the compiler sets the heap address behind the ZI area  
 	– or set by the scatter file, initialize this heap space in the assembly startup code

## STM32 Code Example

```assembly
Heap initialization:
Heap_Size EQU 0x00000C00
AREA HEAP, NOINIT, READWRITE, ALIGN=3; 2X2X2, 8bytes
__heap_base
Heap_Mem SPACE Heap_Size
__heap_limit

Get the stack position:
_main:
__user_initial_stackheap LDR R0, = Heap_Mem ; Heap start address 
LDR R1, =(Stack_Mem + Stack_Size) 
LDR R2, = (Heap_Mem+ Heap_Size) ; Heap end address
LDR R3, = Stack_Mem 
BX LR
```

## Memory Fragment

### Causr of memory fragmentation

• Large and frequent application/release of memory
• In the end, the application for memory may fail and the system may crash

Programming Advice
• Try not to use malloc/free in bare metal environment
• use an array instead



## Solution

### According to Demand

• Memory pool: fixed-size buffer, avoiding memory fragmentation  
• Heap allocation: apply for buffers of different sizes and save memory resources

### Solutions for Different System Platforms

• Bare-metal platform: implement the memory management solution by yourself  
• OS platform: let the operating system intervene in memory management
