# 4.10 uc/os Heap Memory Management



## Memory Partition

- Divide the heap memory into several regions.    
- Each region is divided into several equally sized memory blocks.    
- The program allocates/frees memory in units of memory blocks

## Memory Control Block

### Memory Control Block _MEM

• Memory partition is the basic unit of operating system memory management  
• Each memory partition is represented by a memory control block

```c
typedef struct os_mem 
{ 
	/* MEMORY CONTROL BLOCK */ 
	void *OSMemAddr; /* 内存分区指针*/ /* memory partition pointer */
	void *OSMemFreeList; /* 空闲内存控制块链表指针*/ /* Free memory control block linked list pointer */
	INT32U OSMemBlkSize; /* 每个内存快长度*/ /* Each memory fast length */
	INT32U OSMemNBlks; /* 分区内总的内存块数目*/ /* The total number of memory blocks in the partition */
	INT32U OSMemNFree; /* 分区内空闲内存块个数 */ /* The number of free memory blocks in the partition */
	
	#if OS_MEM_NAME_EN > 0u /* This is a preprocessor conditional directive that checks whether the value of the macro OS_MEM_NAME_EN is greater than zero (0u is used to represent an unsigned integer literal 0). This condition determines whether the following code block should be compiled or not.*/
    	INT8U *OSMemName; /* 分区名字*/ 
	#endif 
} OS_MEM;
```



## Memory Control Block Free Linked List

• The os_mem.c\OS_MemInit() function defines and initializes the linked list  
• Each memory control block represents a memory partition  
• Each memory control block is linked into a linked list with pointers  
• The entire linked list represents the entire free memory  
• Define the maximum number of memory control blocks in OS_CFG.H: OS_MAX_MEM_PART

## *μC*/*OS* Heap Memory

### Code Analysis: Memory Partition

• Initialize dynamic heap memory: OSMemCeate  
• Request a block of memory: OS_MemGet  
• Release a block of memory: OS_MemPut

### Process 1: Create memory partitions

![04](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/04%20Stack%20Memory%20Management/4.10%20ucos%20Heap%20Memory%20Management.assets/04.jpg)

### Process 2: Apply a Memory Block

![05](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/04%20Stack%20Memory%20Management/4.10%20ucos%20Heap%20Memory%20Management.assets/05.jpg)

### Process3: Release a Memory Block (Before Releasing)

### ![06](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/04%20Stack%20Memory%20Management/4.10%20ucos%20Heap%20Memory%20Management.assets/06.jpg)

### Process4: Release a Memory Block (After Releasing)

![07](https://github.com/knightsummon/02-Computer-underlying-programming-and-system-optimization/blob/main/04%20Stack%20Memory%20Management/4.10%20ucos%20Heap%20Memory%20Management.assets/07.jpg)

## Defaults

### Rough Memory Management

• The memory block size must be greater than 4 bytes (int 32U), causing memory waste  
• Application memory size cannot exceed the size of the memory block
• When using the requested memory block, you must first know the size of the memory block to prevent out-of-bounds
