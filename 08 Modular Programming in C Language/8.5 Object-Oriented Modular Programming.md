# 8.5 Object-Oriented Modular Programming



## System Definition->Module Division->Module Implementation->Code Reuse

• First there is system definition, then module division and implementation, and code reuse during the implementation process  

### Advantages of object-oriented

Implement code reuse through inheritance and reduce workload  
As an analytical method, simplifying the analysis of complex systems  

### Build systems based on existing modules and objects

– Will fall into the framework defined by resources  
– Interrelation and interaction between modules  
– Dependencies between modules and initialization process
