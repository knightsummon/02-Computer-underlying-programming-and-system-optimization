# 8.12 Header File Analysis: Header File Path



## Header File Path

### Absolute Path

• Start from the root directory  
• #include”/home/wit/c-lesson/chap8/xx.h”  
• #include “F:/litao/project/inc/xx.h”  

### Relative Path

• specifies the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory.   
• Superior directory: #include”../lcd/lcd.h”  
• Current directory: #include”./lcd.h”  
• Relative directory: #include”lcd.h”  // we will focus on this "lcd.h" 's Hierarchy.

## The Include Head Files

• Header file inclusion method 1: `#include “module.h” ` 
• Header file inclusion method 2: `#include <stdio.h>`  

When you run the `gcc -v` command, it displays detailed information about the compiler, including the compiler's search for header files. The following is a simplified example output illustrating the header file search process:

```ruby
$ gcc -v example.c
```

```bash
Using built-in specs.
COLLECT_GCC=gcc
COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/lto-wrapper

Configured with: ...
Thread model: posix
gcc version 9.3.0 (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04)

ignoring nonexistent directory "/usr/local/include/x86_64-linux-gnu"
ignoring nonexistent directory "/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/../../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/include"
#include "..." search starts here:
#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include
 /usr/include
End of search list.
```

## #include<xx.h>

### Header Files Search Hierarchy 

#### 1.Directory specified via `GCC -i`  

You can specify additional directories for GCC to search for header files using the `-I` flag

```bash
gcc -I/path/to/headers myprogram.c -o myprogram
```

#### 2.Directory specified via environment variable `C_INCLUDE_PATH  `

You can also set the `C_INCLUDE_PATH` environment variable to specify additional directories for header file search. For example, assuming you have the same "myheader.h" file in the "/path/to/myheaders" directory, you can set the `C_INCLUDE_PATH` like this:

```bash
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/myheaders
```

#### 3.GCC’s Default Directory  

GCC has default directories where it searches for header files. For instance, "/usr/include" on Linux systems is one of the default directories.

#### 4.Rule: When the same file exists, whichever one is found first will be used  



## #include “xx.h”

### Header Search Hierarchy 

#### 1.Project Current Working Directory
#### 2.Directory specified via `GCC -i`

#### 3.Directory specified via environment variable `C_INCLUDE_PATH  `

#### 4.GCC’s Default Directory  

#### 5.Rule: When the same file exists, whichever one is found first will be used  



## GCC's Default Directory

1. `/usr/include`: **This directory is one of the primary locations where GCC looks for standard C and C++ header files**. **It contains header files for the system's standard libraries**, including functions like `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, and `math.h`. These headers are essential for developing programs in C and C++.
2. `/usr/local/include`: Similar to `/usr/include`, this directory is used to store header files, but it's typically reserved for **locally installed or custom libraries and software**. When you install software manually on your system, its header files may end up in this directory.
3. `/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu`: This directory is specific to c**ertain Linux distributions running on the x86 architecture**, such as 32-bit systems. It contains architecture-specific header files and is used when building software for the x86 architecture.
4. `/usr/lib/gcc/i686-linux-gnu/5/include`: This directory contains header files that are part of the GCC compiler itself. It includes compiler-specific headers that may be needed during the compilation process. The exact path may vary depending on your GCC version and target architecture.
5. `/usr/lib/gcc/i686-linux-gnu/5/include-fixed`: Similar to the previous directory, this directory also contains **GCC-specific header files**. However, the files in this directory are often used for low-level system programming and typically include architecture-specific headers that provide hardware access.
6. `/usr/lib/gcc-cross/arm-linux-gnueabi/5/include`: This directory is specific to **GCC cross-compilers**, which are used for compiling code for a different target architecture (in this case, ARM) than the host system. It contains the necessary header files and libraries for cross-compilation.
