# 8.8 Header File Analysis: Basic Concepts



## Header Files: Small Memory & Swift Code Management

The C language was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s, when computers had relatively small memory capacities, but header files were not designed with memory limitations in mind. The design of header files is more to solve the problems of code organization and modular programming. The C language encourages dividing the program into multiple source files. Each source file can contain the implementation of a function, but the declaration of the function needs to be known at compile time. One of the main purposes of header files is to gather the declarations of these functions in one place so that they can be shared and reused in different source files.

## Declaration of Functions and Variables

### Declare Before Using

• Locality of C language: compile in file units to prevent compilation errors  
• Any identifier must be declared before use (Except Keyword `extern` and Main Function)  
• Declaration is commonly used on Head file. Compiler will Pre-process it before compiles it and allocates no memory for declaration.

### Declaration Method

• Declare within a function  
• Declaration outside function  
• Declare in header file

```
gcc -E a.c //Preprocess
```

## The Role of header Files

### Header File Function

• Data type definition  
• Macro definition  
• Variable declaration  
• Function declaration  
• Module interface export  
• Library interface declaration  

## What is the difference between variable definition and declaration?

• The main difference is whether a memory allocation operation occurs  
• The definition of variables will eventually generate assembly-related operations and allocate memory, because the definition is on the `.txt` User Segmentation, which will allocate space on the user space of the memory  
• The declaration of a variable tells the compiler that the variable is defined elsewhere, which means it will usually processed in the Preprocess period.  
**• Definition can only be once, declaration can be multiple times**  

## Redefinition

### HEAD File Redefinition

### Strong Symbol & Weak Symbol

In multi-person team development projects, the concepts of strong symbols and weak symbols are often closely related to the organization of code, modular development, and linking processes. Here are some uses of strong and weak symbols in this environment:

1.  **Modular Development**: Teams typically break projects into multiple modules or source files, with each developer responsible for one or more modules. The concept of strong and weak symbols helps ensure that symbol naming in different modules does not conflict.

2.  **Header Files and Interfaces**: Header files usually contain function declarations and external variable declarations, which describe as the module's interfaces. In multi-person development, the correct use of header files can ensure interface consistency between modules, thereby supporting modular development.

3.  **External Variables**: If a module needs to access a global variable defined in another module, it is a common practice to declare this variable in a module using the `extern` keyword. **This will make the variable a weak symbol**, allowing multiple modules to reference the same global variable definition.

4.  **Linking Process**: During the linking process, the linker is responsible for resolving symbol references and ensuring that each symbol has a unique definition. The concept of strong and weak symbols allows the linker to reference symbols with the same name in multiple modules, and there are rules to resolve conflicts.

5.  **Library Files**: In team development, **shared libraries (static libraries or dynamic libraries) are often used to organize and reuse code**. Library files contain definitions and declarations of various functions and data structures. Symbols in libraries are usually strong symbols because they need to be referenced  and used by multiple modules, and the linker needs to know how to resolve these symbols.

Overall, the concept of strong and weak symbols helps in multi-person development projects to isolate modules, ensure interface consistency, support code reuse, resolve symbol conflicts, and correctly resolve symbols during the linking process. These concepts facilitate team collaboration, ensuring that modules written by different developers work together and ultimately form a complete program.
