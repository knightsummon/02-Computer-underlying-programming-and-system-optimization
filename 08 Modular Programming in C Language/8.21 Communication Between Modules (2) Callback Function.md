# 8.21 Communication Between Modules (2): Callback Function



## Three Ways for Module Communication 

Module interfaces play a crucial role in software design, allowing modules or components of a system to communicate and interact with each other. There are different types of module interfaces, including function calling interfaces and message communication interfaces. Here's an overview of each type:

**Function Calling Interface:**

1. **Ordinary Function Calls:**

   - Ordinary function calls involve one module or component invoking a function defined in another module directly.

   - This is a common method of communication, where one module passes parameters to another module's function and receives a return value.

   - It is synchronous in nature, meaning the calling module typically waits for the called module to complete its operation before continuing.

   - Here's a simple example in C:

     ```c
     cCopy code// Module A
     int add(int a, int b) {
         return a + b;
     }
     
     // Module B
     int result = add(3, 5); // Function call to Module A
     ```

2. **Callback Function:**

   - Callback functions are used when one module provides a function to be called by another module at a specific point in time or when a certain event occurs.

   - Callbacks are commonly used in event-driven programming, where one module registers a callback function to be invoked when a particular event occurs.

   - It allows for asynchronous communication between modules.

   - Here's a simplified example in C:

     ```c
     cCopy code// Module A
     void registerCallback(void (*callback)(void)) { // Pointer Function to select function
         // Store the callback function for later use
         // ...
     }
     
     // Module B
     void myCallbackFunction(void) {
         // This function will be called by Module A when an event occurs
         // ...
     }
     
     // Register the callback function
     registerCallback(myCallbackFunction);
     ```

**Message Communication Interface:**

1. **Asynchronous Communication:**

   - Asynchronous communication interfaces enable modules to exchange messages or signals without the need for direct function calls.
   - Asynchronous communication can include various mechanisms such as message passing, semaphores, interrupts, and event-driven programming.
   - These interfaces are often used in multi-threaded, multi-process, or event-driven systems where modules need to react to events or signals asynchronously.
   - Examples include message queues in message passing systems, semaphore signals for synchronization, hardware interrupts, and event-driven programming where modules respond to events triggered by user interactions or external stimuli.

   Here's a simplified example using a message queue in C:

   ```c
   cCopy code// Module A
   // Send a message to Module B
   send_message_to_module_B("Hello from Module A");
   
   // Module B
   // Receive and process messages asynchronously
   while (1) {
       char *message = receive_message_from_module_A();
       process_message(message);
   }
   ```

Each type of interface has its use cases and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the software architecture and design. Function calling interfaces are typically used for synchronous communication, while message communication interfaces are suitable for asynchronous communication and event-driven systems. The choice depends on the desired behavior and synchronization needs of the modules involved.

### Two-way Communication/双向通讯

### Definition

Common calling methods: In a typical application, you write code to actively call functions of the system, library, or low-level module. For example, you might write code to open a file, send a network request, or perform other operations, and your code proactively makes these calls.

**The concept of callback function**: Different from the above method, the callback function is a function written by the user, and its address is passed to the system, library, or underlying module. This function is called a callback function because the system or module calls it back when a specific condition or event occurs. This mechanism enables you to register your own code with the system so that the system can interact with your code when needed.

```c
// main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "event_handler.h"

// Callback function 1
void callbackFunction1(int value) {
    printf("Callback 1 called with value: %d\n", value);
}

// Callback function 2
void callbackFunction2(int value) {
    printf("Callback 2 called with value: %d\n", value);
}

int main() {
    // Register callbackFunction1 with the event handler
    eventHandlerRegister(callbackFunction1);

    // Register callbackFunction2 with the event handler
    eventHandlerRegister(callbackFunction2);

    // Simulate an event
    int eventdetect; 
    if(eventdetect == 42) // when the 42 event occurs
    eventHandlerSimulateEvent(eventdetect);

    return 0;
}
```

```c
//event_handler.h: This header file defines the interface for the event handler.
#ifndef EVENT_HANDLER_H
#define EVENT_HANDLER_H

typedef void (*CallbackFunction)(int);

// Function to register a callback
void eventHandlerRegister(CallbackFunction callback);

// Function to simulate an event
void eventHandlerSimulateEvent(int eventValue);

#endif
```

```c
//event_handler.c: This source file contains the implementation of the event handler.
#include "event_handler.h"

// Array to store registered callbacks
static CallbackFunction callbacks[10];
static int callbackCount = 0;

// Function to register a callback
void eventHandlerRegister(CallbackFunction callback) {
    if (callbackCount < 10) {
        callbacks[callbackCount++] = callback;
    }
}

// Function to simulate an event
void eventHandlerSimulateEvent(int eventValue) {
    printf("Event occurred.\n");

    // Call registered callbacks with the event value
    for (int i = 0; i < callbackCount; i++) {
        callbacks[i](eventValue);
    }
}
```

1. **User-Defined Callback Functions:** In `main.c`, we define two user-defined callback functions, `callbackFunction1` and `callbackFunction2`. These functions are written by the user and are intended to be called back by the event handler module when an event occurs.
2. **Registration of Callbacks:** In the `main` function, we register these user-defined callback functions with the event handler using `eventHandlerRegister(callbackFunction1)` and `eventHandlerRegister(callbackFunction2)`. We pass the addresses of these functions to the event handler, enabling the event handler to call them back when needed.
3. **Callback Mechanism:** The event handler (`event_handler.c`) simulates an event using `eventHandlerSimulateEvent(42)`. When this event occurs, it calls back the registered callback functions (in this case, `callbackFunction1` and `callbackFunction2`) with the event value, as indicated by `callbacks[i](eventValue)`.

The key takeaway here is that the user writes their own callback functions and registers them with a system or module (the event handler in this case). The system or module later invokes these user-defined functions when specific events or conditions occur. This demonstrates the concept of callback functions, where the system "calls back" to the user's code when needed, enabling custom behavior in response to events.

## Decoupling Callback Functions

### Dependency Inversion Principle

• Robert Martin  
• High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, they all depend on an abstraction  
• Abstract cannot rely on concreteness, concreteness depends on abstraction  
• **Inter-module decoupling: define an abstract interface (as intermediary) between two modules**

### Example

See the `device_manager.c` and `device_manager.h` together as an abstract class responsible for adding device. All device are couple with one class, reducing the module coupling.

**Callback Function is widely used in the Linux device driver.**
