# 8.4 Division of System Modules



## The Concept of System and Module

### Basic Concept

• System: Various objects are related and interact with each other to form an organic whole with specific functions.  
• Modularization: decompose, design and implement system goals in modules  
• Module: an organic unit with independent functions, the product of the modularization process

### The Relationship Between Systems and Modules

• First there is system definition and function definition, then module dividing, and finally there are modules  
• The external functions of the system are realized by the collaborative interaction of multiple internal modules

## System Modular Design

### Basic Process

• Determine system goals and functions  
– Jajangmyeon  
• Design a set of collaborative workflows based on system functions and goals  
–Grow local grain, make flour from grain, and make noodles and fried noodles from flour  
• Determine roles, division of labor, and relationships between roles for workflow  
– Farmers: output grain; workers: output flour; chefs: output Jajangmyeon  
• Design component objects corresponding to different roles: modules  
–Farmer.c worker.c cook.c  

## Example of Module Division

### Student Score Management System

#### –Teacher Module:

• Grade input  
• Grade modification  
• Grade deletion  
• Class performance statistics: average score of each subject, number of failures, highest score, lowest score  

#### –Student modules:

• Result inquiry  
• Performance statistics: personal average score, ranking  

## Embedded System Module Layering

• Based on system level division  
• Many modules: hardware, OS, application layer  
• Module relationship: top-bottom, dependency relationship

Different Modules on different layers based on own Features, each feature requires other feature to linked up, which called dependency.

## Benefits of Layered Design

• Clear hierarchy and structure  
• Convenient system expansion: easy to add and delete modules  
• System Resource Management: Clear initialization and release sequence of system resources
