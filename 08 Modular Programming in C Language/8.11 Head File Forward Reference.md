# 8.11 Head File: Forward Reference



In C, a "forward reference" typically refers to a situation where a variable or function is referenced or used before it is declared or defined in the code. Forward references can lead to compilation errors or undefined behavior if not handled correctly.

**Definition:**

A forward reference occurs when a program refers to a variable or function before providing a declaration or definition for that variable or function. It can happen in two main contexts:

1. **Forward Declaration of Functions:** When you declare a function without defining it, you provide a forward reference to the function. This allows you to use the function before its actual implementation is encountered in the code.
2. **Forward Reference to Variables:** When you use a variable before declaring it, the compiler doesn't know its type, which can lead to issues. Some compilers might implicitly assume a default type for the variable (e.g., `int`), but this can lead to unexpected behavior and should be avoided.

### Example

**Forward Declaration of Functions:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Forward declaration of a function
void myFunction(); // Function is declared but not defined yet

int main() {
    myFunction(); // Using the function before its definition
    return 0;
}

// Actual function definition
void myFunction() {
    printf("Hello from myFunction!\n");
}
```

**Forward Reference to Variables:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("The value of x is: %d\n", x); // Using 'x' before declaring it
    int x = 42; // Declaration and initialization of 'x'
    printf("Now, the value of x is: %d\n", x);
    return 0;
}

```

## Three Situation Allows Forward Reference

1. **Implicit Declaration (forbidden by C99/C++):**

   In earlier versions of C, it was allowed to use functions without explicitly declaring or defining them, and the **compiler would implicitly assume a function's signature**. However, this practice is forbidden in C99 and C++, and it's generally considered bad practice. Below is an example:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   int main() {
       foo(); // Implicit declaration of 'foo'
       return 0;
   }
   
   void foo() {
       printf("Hello from foo!\n");
   }
   ```

   In this example, `foo` is used before being explicitly declared or defined. In older C standards, the compiler would assume a default function signature, but in C99 and C++, this would result in a compilation error.

2. **Statement Label (Scope of Label):**

   In C, you can use a statement label to create a reference point within a function or block of code that you can jump to there using `goto`. You can define the label later in the code. Here's an example:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   int main() {
       goto myLabel; // Forward reference to the label
   
       // Some code here
   
   myLabel:
       printf("Jumped to myLabel\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `goto myLabel;` statement is a forward reference to the label `myLabel`, which is defined later in the code. When the `goto` statement is executed, it jumps to the `myLabel` label.

   But try not use the `goto`, because it is make the code unreadable and easy to be attack.

3. **Incomplete Type Declaration:**

   You can declare an incomplete type before fully defining it. This is often used when you need to **declare a pointer to a struct or union or array**  before the complete definition of the struct or union is available. such as `int print_array (int a[], int len);` , `struct list{ struct list *next; int data };`

   Here's an example:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   // Forward declaration of an incomplete type
   struct Point;
   
   int main() {
       struct Point p; // Declaration of a variable of the incomplete type
       p.x = 10;       // Accessing a member of the incomplete type
       p.y = 20;      // the Compiler makes an assumption about the Structure.
   
       printf("Coordinates: (%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y);
       return 0;
   }
   
   // Full definition of the struct
   struct Point {
       int x;
       int y;
       int z;  // Compiler finally find that the assumption is wrong, there is a z inside.
   };
   ```

   In this example, we forward declare the `struct Point` without defining its members. We can then declare a variable `p` of this incomplete type, and later in the code, we provide the full definition of `struct Point`. This is useful when you want to declare pointers to such structs or when the full definition is spread across multiple files.

   

   **At other Situations, all is "First Definition or Declaration, Then use or reference"**
