# 8.10 Header File Analysis: Variable Declaration



## Extern Declaration

In C and C++ programming, the `extern` keyword is used to declare a variable or a function that is defined in another source file or another part of the program. It's essentially a way to tell the compiler that the variable or function is declared elsewhere and should be found at Linking Period. The `extern` declaration is used for a few different purposes:

1. **External Variable Declaration:**

- When you declare a global variable as `extern` in one source file, it indicates that the variable is defined in another source file. This allows multiple source files to share access to the same global variable.

```c
// File1.c
extern int globalVar; // Declaration of globalVar in another source file

// File2.c
int globalVar = 10; // Definition of globalVar
```

2. **Function Declaration:**

- When you declare a function as `extern`, you're indicating that the function is defined in another source file. This is commonly used when you have functions defined in multiple files, and you want to ensure that the compiler knows about them during the compilation process.

```c
// Function declaration in a header file (e.g., myfunctions.h)
extern void myFunction(int x);

// Function definition in a source file (e.g., myfunctions.c)
void myFunction(int x) {
    // Function implementation
}
```

3. **External Linkage:**

- When applied to global variables or functions at the file scope, `extern` specifies that these symbols have external linkage, meaning they can be accessed from other source files. Without `extern`, the default linkage is internal, limiting their visibility to the outside source file.

```c
// Global variable with external linkage
extern int globalVar;

// Function with external linkage // Only link during the compiler stage 3: Link such as gcc
extern void myFunction(int x);
```

## Distinguish the Definition and Declaration about Keyword `extern`

### Basic Rules

• If `extern` is omitted and there is an initialization statement, it is **Definition**  
• If `extern` is used, there is no initialization statement, it is a **Declaration**  
• If `extern` is omitted and there is no initialization statement, it is a **Tentative Definition**.  
• int i = 10;  
• `extern` int i;  
• int i;  

## Re-recognize Tentative Definition such as `int i`

In C, a "tentative definition" is a special type of declaration for variables at the file scope (i.e., outside of any function). When you declare an integer variable without initializing it, the C standard allows for a tentative definition. This means that the variable is allocated storage, and its initial value is set to zero. If you later define (initialize) the variable, it will update a new value.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Tentative definition of an integer variable 'i'
int i;

int main() {
    // 'i' is accessible here and its value is 0
    printf("The value of i is: %d\n", i);

    // Initialize 'i' with a new value
    i = 42;

    // 'i' now holds the value 42
    printf("The updated value of i is: %d\n", i);

    return 0;
}
```

**In the final analysis, this knowledge is due to the mutual conversion of the `Strong Symbol` and the `Weak Symbol`**
