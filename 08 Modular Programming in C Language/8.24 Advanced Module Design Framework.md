# 8.24 Advanced Module Design: Framework



## Framework?

In software development, a "framework" refers to a pre-established structure or set of tools and guidelines that developers can use as a foundation to build software applications more efficiently. Think of it as a skeleton or scaffolding that provides a solid structure for your application, allowing you to focus on the specific functionality you want to implement rather than reinventing the entire structure from scratch.

Here's how to understand the concept of a framework in software development:

1. **Foundation:** A framework provides a foundational structure for your application. It defines the basic architecture, design patterns, and components, such as libraries, modules, and classes, that you can use to build your software.
2. **Reuse:** Frameworks often come with a collection of pre-written code and functionalities that can be reused across different projects. This promotes code reuse, saving developers time and effort.
3. **Guidelines:** Frameworks come with coding standards, best practices, and conventions that developers should follow. These guidelines help maintain consistency and make it easier for different developers to work on the same project.
4. **Abstraction:** Frameworks abstract away lower-level complexities, allowing developers to focus on solving higher-level problems specific to their application. This abstraction can make development more efficient and less error-prone.
5. **Customization:** While frameworks provide a structure, they are typically designed to be customizable. Developers can extend and adapt the framework to meet the specific requirements of their project.
6. **Community and Support:** Popular frameworks often have a large user community and extensive documentation. This means that developers can find resources, tutorials, and support when working with a particular framework.

Examples of popular frameworks in various programming languages and domains include:

- **Web Development:**
  - **Ruby on Rails** (for Ruby)
  - **Django** (for Python)
  - **Angular** and **React** (for JavaScript)
- **Mobile App Development:**
  - **Flutter** (for creating mobile apps with a single codebase)
  - **React Native** (for building mobile apps using React)
- **Backend Development:**
  - **Express.js** (for Node.js)
  - **Spring Boot** (for Java)
- **Data Science:**
  - **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** (for machine learning and deep learning)

When choosing a framework, developers consider factors such as the programming language, the requirements of the project, the size of the community, and the availability of third-party libraries and plugins.

• Extensible application skeleton  
• Separate and abstract the same functions of many applications  
• Modularize some common functions in the application  
• General modules sink, specialized modules float, and are slowly iterated into frameworks  
• The framework is a semi-finished product: applications can be developed quickly based on the framework  
• Framework example: Development Board  

## Framework and Library

### • Organizational Form

– The framework is equivalent to defining the application skeleton, which can be used for secondary development  
–The library is equivalent to a toolbox, and the modules in the library are basically unrelated.  

### • Reuse Form

– Library: function-level code reuse  
– Framework: module-level code reuse, abstraction of modules and the relationships between modules  

### • Calling Method

**– Library: Users actively call library functions for related functions**
**– Framework: Call the user’s extended application through callbacks**

#### Library: Function-Level Code Reuse

```c
// math_library.h
#ifndef MATH_LIBRARY_H
#define MATH_LIBRARY_H

int add(int a, int b);
int subtract(int a, int b);

#endif
```

```c
// math_library.c
#include "math_library.h"

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}
```

In this example, you have a library (`math_library`) that provides two functions, `add` and `subtract`, which you can use independently in your C programs by including the header file and calling these functions as needed.

#### Framework: Module-Level Code Reuse and Abstraction

In a framework, you work at a higher level of abstraction, where modules and their relationships are defined. Developers extend the framework by creating their own modules and callbacks. Here's a simplified C framework example for a basic event-driven system:

```c
// event_framework.h  // user extended application
#ifndef EVENT_FRAMEWORK_H
#define EVENT_FRAMEWORK_H

typedef void (*EventHandler)(void);

void initializeFramework(void);
void registerEvent(char event, EventHandler handler);
void triggerEvent(char event);

#endif
```

```c
// event_framework.c // user extended application module
#include "event_framework.h"
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_EVENTS 10

typedef struct {
    char event;
    EventHandler handler;
} EventRegistration;

static EventRegistration eventRegistry[MAX_EVENTS];
static int eventCount = 0;

void initializeFramework(void) {
    // Initialize framework-related resources
}

void registerEvent(char event, EventHandler handler) {
    if (eventCount < MAX_EVENTS) {
        eventRegistry[eventCount].event = event;
        eventRegistry[eventCount].handler = handler;
        eventCount++;
    } else {
        printf("Event registry is full. Cannot register more events.\n");
    }
}

void triggerEvent(char event) {
    for (int i = 0; i < eventCount; i++) {
        if (eventRegistry[i].event == event) {
            eventRegistry[i].handler();
        }
    }
}
```

```c
// main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "event_framework.h"

// Define event handler functions
void onEventA(void) {
    printf("Event A handled.\n");
}

void onEventB(void) {
    printf("Event B handled.\n");
}

int main() {
    // Initialize the framework
    initializeFramework();

    // Register event handlers
    registerEvent('A', onEventA); // register the user application extended module
    registerEvent('B', onEventB);

    // Trigger events
    triggerEvent('A'); // This should call onEventA //callback function to call user extended module.
    triggerEvent('B'); // This should call onEventB

    return 0;
}
```

In this framework example, you have a set of functions and a data structure (`eventRegistry`) that abstracts the management of events and their handlers. Developers can extend this framework by registering events and associating them with event handlers. The framework takes care of event dispatching and execution of handlers, allowing for module-level code reuse and abstraction of the relationships between modules.
