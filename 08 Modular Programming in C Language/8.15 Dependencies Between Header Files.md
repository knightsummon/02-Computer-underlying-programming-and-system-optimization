# 8.15 Dependencies Between Header Files



## The meaning of Header Files

• Module encapsulation: interface declaration  
• System level: module dependency relationship

## Inspect the Dependencies between Header Files

Correct:

Wrong Again

Now you can image, if there is a team project containing a hundred Header Files, which have dependencies between them. If without **Header Files Inclusion Orders**, there will be endless errors during compile.

## Header Files Inclusion Orders : Avoid Errors caused by Dependency

• #include <C standard library header file>  
• #include <system header file>   
• #include "Third-party library header files"   
• #include "low-level module header files"   
• #include "Header files related to this module"

```c
// Step 1: Include standard C library headers
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Step 2: Include system headers
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

// Step 3: Include third-party library headers
#include "jsonparser.h"
#include "networking.h"

// Step 4: Include low-level module headers
#include "memory.h"
#include "fileio.h"

// Step 5: Include headers related to this module
#include "main.h"

// Your actual code goes here

int main() {
    // Example code
    printf("Hello, world!\n");

    // Function calls and other code
    
    return 0;
}
```

1. Standard C library headers (`<stdio.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`) are included first. These headers provide fundamental functions and types used in C programming.
2. System headers (`<unistd.h>` and `<sys/types.h>`) come next. These headers provide system-level functionality and are typically platform-specific.
3. Third-party library headers ("jsonparser.h" and "networking.h") are included after system headers. These headers belong to external libraries that your code depends on.
4. Low-level module headers ("memory.h" and "fileio.h") are included after third-party library headers. These headers contain functionality specific to your project and may rely on the third-party libraries.
5. Finally, headers related to the current module ("main.h") are included. These headers contain declarations and definitions specific to the module where "main.c" resides.

## Header Files Self Contain

### Reduce the dependency on the Header Files Inclusion Order and Improve the independence of modules

**Self-Contained Header Files**
– Any header file can be compiled independently and used immediately.  
– If you want to include student.h, you don’t need to consider whether to include person.h.  
– Which header files the header file contains depends on itself, not the source file  
– Which header files the source file contains depends on itself, not the header files

### Shortcomings

• Increase dependencies and complicate dependencies between HEADER Files.
• Increase the compilation time of your project

## Reduce dependencies between header files

### Forward Declaration

» If forward declaration is possible, the header file should contain as few other header files as possible  
» Only a data type is required, not its complete definition  
	• Declaration of pointer objects  
	• Function parameter types  
	• Function return value type

## Establish a shared `base.h` file for every Module to use

base.h contains the primary definition such as `struct person`etc for everyone to use.
