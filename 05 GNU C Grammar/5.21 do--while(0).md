# 5.21 do--while(0)



```c
do
{
	code;
	code;
	...
}while(0); // at least do once.
```

### Why should it be defined like this?

• Implement complex macro definitions: functional macros, compound statements  
• use local variables  
• Using complex macro definitions in conditional statements  

```c
#include<stdio.h>
struct student{
	char name[20];
	int age;
};

#define PRINT(a) do{printf("%s\n",a.name);printf("%d\n",a.age);}while(0)

int main(void)
{
	struct student stu={
		"wit",20
	};
	if (0)
		PRINT(stu);
	return 0;
}
```

1. **Single Statement Requirement**: In C and C++, macros are often defined as single lines of code. However, sometimes you might want to define a macro that expands into multiple statements. Control structures like `if`, `else`, and `while` expect a single statement after them. Placing a block of statements directly inside such a control structure could lead to syntax errors, which behave like semicolon conflicts.
2. **Consistency**: Using the `do...while(0)` construct ensures that the macro, whether it's used inside an `if` or standalone, always behaves like a single statement. This consistency avoids surprises due to unexpected behavior when macros are used in different contexts.
3. **Scoping**: The `do...while(0)` construct creates a local scope for the macro's statements. This helps prevent naming conflicts with variables and reduces the chances of unintended interactions with other code.
