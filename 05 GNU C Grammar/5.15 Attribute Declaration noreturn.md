# 5.15 Attribute Declaration: noreturn



```c
void func( int ) __attribute__((noreturn));
```

`__attribute__((noreturn))`: This is a GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) specific attribute applied to the function. It's used to indicate that the function does not return control to the caller. In other words, when a function with the `noreturn` attribute is called, the compiler and optimizer assume that the function will never complete its execution and will either exit the program or enter an infinite loop or raise an exception.
