# 5.8 Attribute Declaration: aligned & packed



## Aligned

effect  
• Address alignment for specifying structure types, union types, and variables  
• Unit: byte  
• Size: Power of 2

when we forcefully define the alignment of the address is 4, the char will given 4 address even 3 inside memory is "0x00000000".

```c
char c2 __attribute__((aligned(4)))=4;
```

### Struct Alignment for Compatibility

Unify the address length of each variable type inside the struct

## packed

### Purpose: Save the memory where is wasted for address alignment.

• Specifying the minimal possible alignment for variables and types (structures, unions, enumerations) 

• Reducing memory padding caused by alignment requirements between elements 

• Example: Register definition"

"Packed" in the context of programming languages like C and C++ refers to a concept where data structures are defined with minimal padding between elements. Normally, compilers add padding between structure members to ensure that each member is aligned in memory to improve memory access efficiency.

However, in some cases, you might want to create data structures without this automatic padding. This is often used when memory efficiency is more important than optimized memory access. This is where the "packed" concept comes into play.

**When you define a structure as "packed," you are telling the compiler not to add any padding between the structure's members.** This can lead to tighter memory layouts but can also potentially slow down memory access due to unaligned data.
