# 5.2 C Standard Development Process and New Features



## C Language Basic Components: 

• Identifiers: Composed of letters, digits, and underscores.   
• Keywords: Reserved identifiers that cannot be used for other purposes.   
• Constants   
• String Constants   
• Operators   
• Delimiters: ( ) [ ] { } ; , . : Whitespace  



## ANSI Standards

## Predefined Identifier/预定义标识符

• Compiler predefined identifiers  
• Standard library function name  
• preprocessing command name

### ANSI C

ANSI (American National Standards Institute) has expanded some new features on the basis of K&R C, so ANSI C is also called C89/C90  
– Add signed, volatile, const keywords  
–Void * data type, void function  
– add preprocessor commands  
– wide character, wide character string  
– Defines the C standard library

### C99

#### Add keywords  

• Boolean: _Bool  
• Complex: _Complex  
• Imaginary: _Imaginary  
• Inline: inline  
• Pointer decoration: restrict  

#### New Data Type

• Support long long, long double, wide characters  
• Support variable length array  
• Structs allow assignment of specific members   
• Supports hexadecimal floating point numbers, float _Complex data type  



### C99 Standard

#### New expression and statement features

• Variable declarations can be anywhere in the text block  
• Each line of source program supports a maximum of 4095 bytes  
• Support // single line comments  
• Modified the handling of negative numbers in division and remainder  

#### Function

• Added and modified some header files: such as stdbool.h, inttypes.h, complex.h, wctype.h, tgmath.h, fenv.h, stdarg.h  
• Canceled the regulation that the return type of the function is int by default  

### C11 Standard

#### New Features

• Increase _Noreturn, declare function without return value  
• Increase _Generic: support for generic programming  
• Modified standard library function vulnerabilities: such as gets() function is replaced by gets_s()  
• New file lock function, new file open method: "x"  
• Support for multithreading  



## Summary:

• Different compilers support the C standard differently, and mainstream compilers now support the C99 standard  
• GNU C has the best standard support for C99  
• Different compilers have more or less their own extensions to the C standard
