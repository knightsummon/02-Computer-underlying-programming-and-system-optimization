# 5.19 Build-in Function: _ _Builtin _ _expect()



## Usage:

• __builtin_expect(exp, c);  
• Return value: exp  
• Significance: It means that the value of exp is very likely to be c  

### Example: 

```c
int main (void)
{
	int a;
	a = __builtin_expect(6, 0)
	printf("%d\n",a);
	
	return 0;
}
```

Printout as the "a=6", compiler are told that the a is possibly to be the 0 at the end.

The "a=6" is the programmer wanted result, so the compiler when compile the source code, it will put the assembly code related to "a=6" put into high priority address(low address), help program to execute, this is called optimization.

## Kernel `__biltin_expect()` Optimization

1. `#define likely(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 1)`: This macro is used to indicate that the condition `x` is likely to be true. The `__builtin_expect` function takes two arguments: the condition `!!(x)` (which converts `x` into a boolean value) and the expected value `1` (which represents "likely"). This hints to the compiler that it should optimize the generated code assuming that the condition is true most of the time. This can lead to more efficient code by optimizing branch predictions for the true case.
2. `#define unlikely(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)`: This macro is used to indicate that the condition `x` is unlikely to be true. Similarly, it uses the `__builtin_expect` function with the condition `!!(x)` and an expected value of `0` (which represents "unlikely"). This informs the compiler that the condition is expected to be false in most cases, allowing the compiler to optimize for the false case.

In both cases, by providing this information to the compiler, you're helping it make better decisions about how to reorder and optimize the generated machine code.
